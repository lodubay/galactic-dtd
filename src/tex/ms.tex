\begin{abstract}
    Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of the Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and \aFe in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in one-zone and multi-zone chemical evolution models using the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE). VICE includes a prescription for radial stellar migration in multi-zone models. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the SN Ia DTD has the largest effect on the \aFe distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower \aFe ratio, whereas a DTD with more delayed SNe Ia produces a distribution that is skewed toward higher \aFe. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the \aFe distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence. Our model results favor a DTD with longer delay times and fewer prompt SNe Ia than the fiducial $t^{-1}$ power law.

\section{Introduction}

% [Hook and intro paragraph]
Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) studies seek to explain the observed distribution of metals throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. \citet{Tinsley1979-StellarLifetimes} made a compelling case that the non-Solar \aFe\footnote{
    In standard bracket notation, $[X/Y]\equiv \log_{10}(X/Y) - \log_{10}(X/Y)_{\odot}$. In this work we will use \aFe and [O/Fe] interchangeably, although observational studies will often use a combination of $\alpha$-elements to calculate \aFe.
} ratios seen by, e.g., \citet{Wallerstein1962-GDwarfAbundances} were caused by different stellar lifetimes for the contributors of the Fe-peak elements than the $\alpha$-elements. 
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs), are responsible for a majority of the Fe produced in the Galaxy \citep{Matteucci1986-SupernovaEnrichment}; meanwhile, core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the explosions of massive stars, produce the $\alpha$-elements (e.g., O and Mg) in addition to a smaller fraction of Fe.
SNe Ia are delayed by $\sim10^8 - 10^{10}$ years after star formation events, as evidenced by observations at large distances from star forming regions and in elliptical galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{Maza1976-SNStatistics}.
This delayed enrichment leads to a decrease in \aFe with increasing [Fe/H] \citep{Matteucci1986-SupernovaEnrichment}.
% The decrease in \aFe with [Fe/H] has long been understood to be a consequence of the delayed nature of SNe Ia, which do not contribute substantially to chemical enrichment for $\sim 10^8$ years after the commencement of star formation \citep{Tinsley1979-StellarLifetimes,Matteucci1986-SupernovaEnrichment}. 
% As SNe Ia are a product of intermediate-mass stars which undergo binary evolution, they do not contribute substantially to chemical enrichment for $\sim 10^8$ years after the commencement of star formation \citep{Matteucci1986-SupernovaEnrichment}.
% The timescale for Fe enrichment in the Galaxy, a key component of chemical evolution models, is directly linked to the progenitor lifetimes of SNe Ia. 
Therefore, the relative abundances of the $\alpha$-elements and Fe as a function of stellar age trace the balance of SN rates over time.

% [What is the delay time distribution]
The rate of SNe Ia which explode as a function of time after the formation of a hypothetical unit-mass single stellar population is known as the delay-time distribution \citep[DTD; for a review, see Section 3.5 of][]{Maoz2014-Review}.
When the DTD is convolved with the Galactic star formation rate (SFR) as a function of time, it yields the SN Ia rate as a function of time. 
The quantitative details of the relationship between \aFe and [Fe/H] are set by the DTD, and as such it is a key parameter in GCE models.
The DTD remains poorly constrained, however, because it reflects the detailed evolution of the SNe Ia progenitor systems, so different models for the progenitors of SNe Ia will naturally predict different forms for the DTD.

% [Introduction to SNe Ia]
The mechanism(s) for producing SNe Ia are not fully understood \citep[for reviews, see][]{Maoz2014-Review,Livio2018-ProgenitorReview,Ruiter2020-ProgenitorReview}. Two general production channels have been proposed. In the single-degenerate (SD) case, the WD accretes mass from a close non-degenerate companion until it surpasses $\sim1.4$ M$_\odot$ and explodes \citep{Whelan1973-SDModel,Nomoto1982-SDModel,Yoon2003-SDModel}. In the double-degenerate (DD) case, two WDs merge after a gravitational-wave inspiral \citep{Iben1984-IaBinary,Webbink1984-DDModel,Pakmor2012-WDMerger} or head-on collision \citep{Benz1989-CollisionalDD,Thompson2011-CollisionalDD}. Searches for signs of interaction between the SN ejecta and a non-degenerate companion \citep[e.g.,][]{Panagia2006-RadioEmission,Chomiuk2016-RadioEmission,Fausnaugh2019-EarlyIaLightCurves,Tucker2020-SNeIaSpectra} or for a surviving non-degenerate companion \citep[e.g.,][]{Schaefer2012-ExCompanionSNR,Do2021-Progenitor1972E,Tucker2023-SN2011fe} have placed tight constraints on the SD channel, heavily disfavoring it as the main pathway for producing ``normal'' SNe Ia. The DD channel, now the preferred model, faces issues of its own with matching observed SN Ia rates because not all WD mergers may lead to a thermonuclear explosion \citep[e.g.,][]{NomotoIben1985-DDMergers,SaioNomoto1998-DDMergers,Shen2012-DDMergers}, and the progenitor systems are difficult to detect even within our own Galaxy \citep{RebassaMansergas2019-WhereAreDDProgenitors}.

% [Theoretical DTDs]
Uncertainties in the progenitor channels of SNe Ia translate into uncertainties in the shape of the DTD. 
% By formulating analytical DTDs for several progenitor models, \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} found that the SD channel tends to produce a steeper DTD function than the DD channel, and the median delay time (by which 50\% of SNe Ia have exploded) can vary by a factor of 10 depending on the chosen progenitor scenario and its particular parameters.
For the DD channel, assumptions about the distribution of post-common envelope separations and the rate of gravitational wave inspiral suggest a broad $\sim t^{-1}$ DTD at long delay times ($\gtrsim 1$ Gyr), but at short delays ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) the rate is limited by the need to produce two WDs \citep[see Section 3.5 from][]{Maoz2014-Review}.
Higher-order progenitor systems could also produce a $t^{-1}$ DTD \citep{Fang2018-QuadrupleSystems,Rajamuthukumar2023-TripleEvolution}.
The DTD which would result from the SD channel depends greatly on the assumptions of binary population synthesis, but in general is expected to cover a narrower range of delay times and may feature a steep exponential cutoff at the long end \citep[e.g.,][]{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}.
% More recently, \citet{Rajamuthukumar2023-TripleEvolution} computed a DTD from the evolution of triple system progenitors. [Expand, connect binary evolution to delay times, look for other theory papers]

% [Observational DTDs]
Surveys of SNe Ia have provided the primary observational constraints on the DTD.  
This can be done by comparing the observed rate of SNe Ia to their host galaxy parameters \citep[e.g.,][]{Mannucci2005-SNRate,Heringer2019-FieldGalaxyDTD} or inferred star formation histories \citep[SFHs; e.g.,][]{Maoz2012-SloanIIDTD}, measuring SN Ia rates in galaxy clusters \citep[e.g.,][]{Maoz2010-ClusterDTD}, or comparing the volumetric SN Ia rate to the cosmic SFH as a whole \citep[e.g.,][]{Graur2014-VolumetricSNIaRates,Strolger2020-ExponentialDTD}. 
Early studies, which had limited sample sizes, produced unimodal \citep{Strolger2004-SNIaProgenitors} or bimodal \citep{Mannucci2006-TwoPopulations} DTDs where the majority of SNe Ia explode within a relatively narrow range of delay times.
More recent studies have recovered broader DTD functions, with many converging on a declining power-law of $\sim t^{-1}$ \citep[e.g.,][]{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD,Castrillo2021-DTD,Wiseman2021-DESRates}, though there is some evidence for a steeper slope in galaxy clusters \citep{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD,FriedmannMaoz2018-ClusterDTD}.
It is especially difficult to constrain the DTD for short delay times \citep{MaozMannucci2012-SNeIaReview} because of the need for SN Ia rates at long lookback times and uncertainties in the age estimates of stellar populations.

% Notes on observational DTDs:
% \citet{Strolger2004-SNIaProgenitors} analyzed 42 SNe Ia with redshifts $0.2<z<1.6$ and favored a delayed ($\gtrsim2$ Gyr) narrow Gaussian DTD while disfavoring exponentially declining models with a large fraction of prompt SNe Ia.
% \citet{Mannucci2005-SNRate} found that the SN Ia rate per unit mass has a strong dependence on host galaxy morphology and color. Using these results, \citet{Mannucci2006-TwoPopulations} obtained a best-fit model for the DTD which consists of both a prompt component ($<100$ Myr) and a long exponential tail. 
% The Maoz studies all assume a particular form for the DTD and fit for the specific parameters. They do not quantitatively favor one form over another (e.g., power-law over exponential). 
% \citet{Castrillo2021-DTD} find a best fit power law slope of $\alpha\approx-1.1$ with a minimum delay time of $\sim50$ Myr, they also find a fairly high correlation between SN Ia rate and H$\alpha$ (a proxy for young stars) which is surprising.
% \citet{Stolger2020-ExponentialDTD} perform maximum likelihood estimations based on the cosmic star formation history and the star formation histories of individual galaxies. In both cases their best fit functions were approximately exponential, though they started with a skew-normal function so could not have ended up with a power law even if they wanted to. They don't actually report the timescale of this exponential, but based on the plots I'd say it's about 1.5 - 2 (1.7?) Gyr. Their best fit parameters make no sense to me as they don't report their units.

The uncertainties in the SN Ia DTD propagate into GCE models. In principle, then, the observed chemical abundance patterns should contain information about the DTD, and therefore the progenitors, of SNe Ia.
A few studies have compared different DTDs in one-zone chemical evolution models, but their comparisons to abundance data are limited to the local Solar neighborhood \citep[e.g.,][]{Andrews2017-ChemicalEvolution,Palicio2023-AnalyticDTD}. 
\citet{Poulhazan2018-PrecisionPollution} compared six DTD models in a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulation in a cosmological context. They found that models with a prompt SN Ia component produced the highest abundance ratios and the narrowest \aFe distributions at late times, although their simulation was not tuned to reproduce the parameters of the Milky Way and they did not compare to observed chemical abundances. 
The current era of large spectroscopic surveys such as the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE;][]{Majewski2017-APOGEE} and the forthcoming Milky Way Mapper [cite] has made abundances across the Milky Way disk available for comparison to more sophisticated GCE models.

% Notes on GCE studies
% \citet{Andrews2017-ChemicalEvolution} predict abundance tracks and distributions using one-zone models for four different DTD models; they find that most are consistent with their abundance data.
% \citet{Palicio2023-AnalyticDTD} derive analytic solutions to one-zone chemical evolution equations for seven DTD models, but their comparisons to data are limited to the Solar neighborhood. 
% \citet{Poulhazan2018-PrecisionPollution} investigate six different DTD models in a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulation, but they only present global results for the entire galaxy, they don't compare abundances throughout the disk, and they don't compare to observations.

This paper presents the first comprehensive look at the DTD in a multi-zone GCE model that can qualitatively reproduce the observed abundance structure of the Milky Way disk. We evaluate a selection of DTD models from the literature with multiple SFHs and a prescription for radial stellar migration in the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution \citep[VICE;][]{JohnsonWeinberg2020-Starbursts}. In Section \ref{sec:methods}, we present our models for the DTD and SFH, and we describe our chemical evolution models. In Section \ref{sec:onezone-results}, we present the results of our one-zone chemical evolution models. In Section \ref{sec:multizone-results}, we present the results of our multi-zone models and compare to observations. In Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss the implications for the DTD and future surveys. In Section \ref{sec:conclusions}, we summarize our conclusions.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

We make use of the multi-zone simulation tools in VICE developed by \citet{Johnson2021-Migration} (hereafter \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}). The basic setup of our models follows theirs: the simulated Galaxy is a disk with a radius of 20 kpc and is divided into concentric rings of width $\delta R_{\rm gal}=100$ pc. The gas in each ring is assumed to be instantaneously mixed; while star particles are allowed to migrate radially (see Appendix \ref{app:migration}), there is no exchange of gas between rings. We run our simulations with a time-step size of $\Delta t=10$ Myr up to a maximum time of $t_{\rm max}=13.2$ Gyr. Following \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, we set VICE to form $n=8$ stellar populations per ring per time-step, and we set a maximum star-formation radius of $R_{\rm SF} = 15.5$ kpc, such that $\dot\Sigma_*=0$ for $R_{\rm gal}>R_{\rm SF}$ (stars are allowed to migrate past $R_{\rm SF}$, they are just not born there).

Table \ref{tab:multizone-parameters} summarizes many of the parameters in our multi-zone models.

\subsection{Nucleosynthetic Yields}
\label{sec:yields}

Like \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, we focus our analysis on O and Fe, representing the $\alpha$ and Fe-peak elements, respectively. Both elements are produced by CCSNe. VICE adopts the instantaneous recycling approximation for CCSNe, so the equation which governs CCSN enrichment as a function of star formation for some element $x$ is simply
\begin{equation}
    \dot M_x^{\rm CC} = y_x^{\rm CC} \dot M_*
    \label{eq:ccsn-enrichment}
\end{equation}
where $y_x^{\rm CC}$ is the CCSN yield of element $x$ per unit mass of star formation, and $\dot M_*$ is the SFR. Following \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, who in turn adopt their yields from \citet{Weinberg2017-ChemicalEquilibrium}, we adopt $y_{\rm O}^{\rm CC}=0.015$ and $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm CC}=0.0012$. The primary effect of these yields is to set the ``plateau'' in [O/Fe] which represents pure CCSN enrichment. The chosen yields for this paper produce a plateau at [O/Fe]$=0.45$; see \citet{Weinberg2023-CCSNYield} for more discussion.

Following the formalism of \citet{Weinberg2017-ChemicalEquilibrium}, the rate of Fe contribution to the ISM from SNe Ia is 
\begin{equation}
    \dot M_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia} = y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia} \langle \dot M_*\rangle_{\rm Ia} \\
\end{equation}
where $\langle \dot M_*\rangle_{\rm Ia}$ is the time-averaged SFR weighted by the DTD and $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}$ is the Fe yield of SNe Ia. \citet{Weinberg2017-ChemicalEquilibrium} show in their Appendix A that
\begin{equation}
    \langle \dot M_*\rangle_{\rm Ia} \equiv \frac{\int_0^t \dot M_*(t')R_{\rm Ia}(t-t')dt'}{\int_{t_D}^{t_{\rm max}} R_{\rm Ia}(t')dt'}
    \label{eq:weighted-sfr}
\end{equation}
where %$\dot M_*(t)$ is the SFR at time $t$, 
%$R_{\rm Ia}(t) dt$ is the number of SNe Ia which explode in the time interval $(t, t+dt)$ per unit mass of stars formed at $t=0$, 
$R_{\rm Ia}$ is the DTD in units of ${\rm M}_\odot^{-1}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$,
$t_D$ is the minimum SN Ia delay time, and $t_{\rm max}$ is the maximum simulation time. The denominator of Equation \ref{eq:weighted-sfr} is therefore the total number of SNe Ia per M$_{\odot}$ of stars formed.

The yield $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}$ measures the mass of Fe produced by SNe Ia per unit mass of star formation. It can be expressed in terms of the integral of the DTD:
\begin{equation}
    y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia} = m_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia} \int_{t_D}^{t_{\rm max}} R_{\rm Ia}(t')dt' = m_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia} \frac{N_{\rm Ia}}{M_*}
    \label{eq:dtd-integral}
\end{equation}
where $m_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}$ is the average mass of Fe produced by a single SN Ia. We take the average number of SNe Ia per mass of stars formed to be $N_{\rm Ia}/M_*=2.2\times10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ from \citet{MaozMannucci2012-SNeIaReview}.%, which gives $R_{\rm Ia}$ units of ${\rm M}_\odot^{-1}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. 
Following \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, we take $y_{\rm Fe}^{\rm Ia}=0.00214$. This yield was selected so that the inside-out SFH model produces stars with [O/Fe]$\approx 0.0$ by the end of the simulation. SNe Ia do not contribute O so $y_{\rm O}^{\rm Ia}=0$.

\subsection{DTD Models}
\label{sec:dtd-models}

We explore five different functional forms for the SN Ia DTD: a power-law, a broken power-law with an initial flat plateau, an exponential, a two-population model, and a model based on triple-system dynamics, with a one or two variants of each. We present the unnormalized functional forms for $R_{\rm Ia}(t)$ below; VICE automatically normalizes and scales the DTD to produce the correct number of SNe Ia over the lifetime of the Galaxy. Figure \ref{fig:dtds} presents these DTDs as a function of time after star formation, and Table \ref{tab:dtds} summarizes the DTD models and their parameters.

\end{deluxetable*}

\paragraph{Power-law} A simple power law with slope $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) \propto (t/1\,\rm{Gyr})^\alpha
    \label{eq:powerlaw-dtd}
\end{equation}
% where $A_\alpha = (\alpha+1)(t_{\rm max}^{\alpha+1} - t_{\rm min}^{\alpha+1})^{-1}$ is the normalization coefficient.
A declining power-law with $\alpha\sim-1$ is expected to arise from typical assumptions about the distribution of post-common envelope separations and the rate of gravitational wave inspiral \citep[see Section 3.5 from][]{Maoz2014-Review}. It is therefore a commonly assumed DTD in GCE studies \citepalias[e.g.,][]{Johnson2021-Migration}. Additionally, the observational evidence for a power-law DTD is strong. \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} obtain a DTD with $\alpha=-1.07\pm0.09$ based on volumetric rates and an assumed cosmic SFH for field galaxies in redshift range $0\leq z\leq 2.25$. \citet{Wiseman2021-DESRates} obtain a similar slope of $\alpha=-1.13\pm0.05$ for field galaxies in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.6$. For galaxy clusters, \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} find a steeper DTD slope of $\alpha=-1.39^{+0.32}_{-0.05}$. \citet{Heringer2019-FieldGalaxyDTD} use a SFH-independent method to constrain the DTD for field galaxies within $0.01<z<0.2$ and find a steeper slope of $\alpha=-1.34^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$.
In this paper, we investigate the cases $\alpha=-1.1$ and $\alpha=-1.4$.

\paragraph{Plateau} A modification of the simple power-law in which the DTD ``plateaus'' for a duration $W$ before declining:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) \propto
    \begin{cases}
        1, & t < W \\
        (t/W)^\alpha, & t \ge W
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:plateau-dtd}
\end{equation}
% where $B_W=[(W-t_{\rm min}) + \frac{t_{\rm max}^{\alpha+1} - W^{\alpha+1}}{(\alpha+1)W^\alpha}]^{-1}$ is the normalization coefficient.
Our primary motivation is to consider a model which matches observations at delay times beyond a few Gyr, where the DTD is best constrained, but which has a much smaller fraction of prompt ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) SNe Ia.
To our knowledge, this form of the DTD has not been considered in previous studies. However, we show in Appendix \ref{app:analytical-dtds} that this form can approximate the more complicated analytical DD DTDs from \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}. We investigate the cases $W=0.3$ Gyr and $W=1$ Gyr, taking $\alpha=-1.1$ for all plateau models.

\paragraph{Triple-system} A DTD based on simulations of triple-system evolution by \citet{Rajamuthukumar2023-TripleEvolution}. We approximate their numerically-generated DTD as a special case of the plateau model (Equation \ref{eq:plateau-dtd}) where the initial rate is quite low until an instantaneous rise to the plateau value at time $t_{\rm rise}$:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) \propto
    \begin{cases}
        \epsilon, & t < t_{\rm rise} \\
        1, & t_{\rm rise} \leq t < W \\
        (t / W) ^ \alpha, & t \geq W
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:triple-dtd}
\end{equation}
with $t_{\rm rise}=0.5$ Gyr, $W=0.5$ Gyr, $\alpha=-1.1$, and $\epsilon=0.05$ so the initial rate is 5\% of the peak rate.

\paragraph{Exponential} An exponentially declining DTD with timescale $\tau$:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) \propto \frac{1}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau}
    \label{eq:exponential-dtd}
\end{equation}
This model can be used to calculate an analytic solution to the equations of chemical equilibrium, making it a popular choice among GCE studies. \citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing} and \citet{Weinberg2017-ChemicalEquilibrium} both assume an exponential DTD with a timescale $\tau=1.5$ Gyr. We show in Appendix \ref{app:analytical-dtds} that a $\tau=1.5$ Gyr exponential is an adequate approximation for the analytical SD DTD from \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}. 
There is less observational support for an exponential DTD. \citet{Strolger2020-ExponentialDTD}, fitting to the cosmic SFH and SFHs from field galaxies, find a range of exponential-like solutions with timescales $\sim 1.5 - 6$ Gyr.
In this paper we investigate timescales $\tau=1.5$ and 3 Gyr.
% I've looked at Matteucci & Greggio (1986) and I'm not sure what their DTD would be

\paragraph{Two-population} A DTD in which $\sim50\%$ of SNe Ia belong to a ``prompt'' Gaussian component at small $t$ and the remainder form an exponential tail at large $t$:
\begin{equation}
    R_{\rm Ia}(t) \propto 0.5\Big[e^{-\frac{(t-t_p)^2}{2\sigma^2}} + e^{-t/\tau}\Big]
    \label{eq:prompt-dtd}
\end{equation}
To approximate the DTD from \citet{Mannucci2006-TwoPopulations}, we take $t_p=50$ Myr, $\sigma=15$ Myr, and $\tau=3$ Gyr, which results in $\sim 50\%$ of SNe Ia exploding within $t<100$ Myr. This formulation is slightly different than the approximation used in other GCE studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Matteucci2006-BimodalDTDConsequences,Poulhazan2018-PrecisionPollution}, where it has a more distinctly bimodal shape. We have compared the two approximations to this DTD in a one-zone model and found that they produce very similar abundance tracks and MDFs. This DTD is adopted by the Feedback In Realistic Environments \citep[FIRE;][]{Hopkins2014-FIRE-1} and FIRE-2 \citep{Hopkins2018-FIRE-2} simulations.

\subsubsection{The Minimum SN Ia Delay Time}

In addition to the DTD shape, the minimum SN Ia delay time $t_D$ is another parameter which can have an effect on chemical evolution observables, such as the location of the high-$\alpha$ knee and the [O/Fe] DF \citep{Andrews2017-ChemicalEvolution}. The value of $t_D$ is set by the lifetime of the most massive SN Ia progenitor system. Previous GCE studies have adopted values ranging from $t_D\approx30$ Myr \citep[e.g.,][]{Poulhazan2018-PrecisionPollution} to $t_D=150$ Myr \citepalias[e.g.,][]{Johnson2021-Migration}. We take $t_D=40$ Myr to be our fiducial value as it is the approximate lifetime of an $8\,{\rm M}_\odot$ star. In Section \ref{sec:onezone-results} we find that adopting a longer $t_D$ has only a minor effect on the chemical evolution for most DTD models except the power-law, but in that case the effect of a longer $t_D$ can be approximated by adding an initial plateau of width $W=0.3$ Gyr to the DTD (see Figure \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel}).

\subsection{Star Formation Histories}
\label{sec:sfh}

We consider four models for the SFH: inside-out, late-burst, early-burst, and two-infall. The first two models are taken from \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration} and are run in VICE's ``star formation mode,'' where the SFR surface density $\dot\Sigma_*$ is prescribed along with the star formation efficiency (SFE) timescale $\tau_*\equiv \Sigma_g/\dot\Sigma_*$. The remaining quantities, infall rate surface density $\dot\Sigma_{\rm in}$ and gas surface density $\Sigma_g$, are calculated from the specified quantities. The latter two models are run in ``infall mode,'' where we specify $\dot\Sigma_{\rm in}$ and $\tau_*$. All models have zero initial gas mass in all zones. We present an overview of these models in Figure \ref{fig:sfhs}.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/star_formation_histories.pdf}
    \caption{The surface densities of star formation $\dot \Sigma_*$ (first row), gas infall $\dot \Sigma_{\rm in}$ (second row), and gas mass $\Sigma_g$ (third row), and the SFE timescale $\tau_*$ (fourth row) as functions of simulation time for our four model SFHs: inside-out (first column; see Equation \ref{eq:insideout-sfh}), late-burst (second column; see Equation \ref{eq:lateburst-sfh}), early-burst (third column; see Equations \ref{eq:earlyburst-ifr} and \ref{eq:earlyburst-taustar}), and two-infall (fourth column; see Equation \ref{eq:twoinfall-ifr}). In each panel, we plot curves for the simulation zones which have inner radii at 4 kpc (yellow), 6 kpc (orange), 8 kpc (red), 10 kpc (violet), 12 kpc (indigo), and 14 kpc (blue).}
    \label{fig:sfhs}
    \script{star_formation_histories.py}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Inside-out} As in \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, this is our fiducial SFH. The dimensionless time-dependence of the SFR is given by
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm IO}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = (1 - e^{-t/\tau_{\rm rise}}) e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}
    \label{eq:insideout-sfh}
\end{equation}
where we assume $\tau_{\rm rise}=2$ Gyr for all radii. The SFH timescale $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ varies with $R_{\rm gal}$, with $\tau_{\rm sfh}(R_{\rm gal}=8\,\rm{kpc})\approx15$ Gyr at the Solar annulus and longer timescales in the outer galaxy. The $\tau_{\rm sfh} - R_{\rm gal}$ relation is determined from the data of \citet{Sanchez2020-StarFormationTimescales}; see Section 2.5 of \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration} for the details. For a detailed look at the normalization of the SFR with $R_{\rm gal}$, we refer the reader to Appendix B of \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}.

\paragraph{Late-burst} A variation on the inside-out SFH with a Gaussian burst in the SFR at late times:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm LB}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = f_{\rm IO}(t|R_{\rm gal}) \Big(1 + A_b e^{-(t-t_b)^2/2\sigma_b^2} \Big)
    \label{eq:lateburst-sfh}
\end{equation}
where $A_b$ is the dimensionless amplitude of the starburst, $t_b$ is the time of the peak of the burst, and $\sigma_b$ is the width of the Gaussian. Following \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, we adopt $A_b=1.5$, $t_b=11.2$ Gyr, and $\sigma_b=1$ Gyr. The determination of $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ 
% and the normalization of the SFR as a function of $R_{\rm gal}$ 
is the same as in the inside-out case.

\paragraph{Early-burst} An extension of the model proposed by \citet{Conroy2022-ThickDisk} to explain the non-monotonic behavior of the high-$\alpha$ sequence down to ${\rm [Fe/H]}\approx-2.5$. An abrupt factor $\sim20$ rise in the SFE at early times drives an increase in the [O/Fe] abundance and populates the high-$\alpha$ sequence. We adopt the formula for the time-dependence of the SFE timescale from \citet{Conroy2022-ThickDisk}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tau_{\rm EB}}{1\,\rm{Gyr}} =
    \begin{cases}
        50, & t < 2.5\,\rm{Gyr} \\
        \frac{50}{[1+3(t-2.5)]^2}, & 2.5\leq t \leq 3.7\,\rm{Gyr} \\
        2.36, & t > 3.7\,\rm{Gyr}.
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-taustar}
\end{equation}
In contrast to the previous SFH models, we run the early-burst model in ``infall'' mode.
While \citet{Conroy2022-ThickDisk} use a constant infall rate in their one-zone model, we adopt a radially-dependent infall rate which declines exponentially with time:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm EB}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-ifr}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ is the same as in the inside-out case.
To calculate $\dot \Sigma_*$ from the above quantities, we modify the fiducial star formation law adopted from \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, substituting $\tau_{\rm EB}$ for the SFE timescale of molecular gas:
\begin{equation}
    \dot \Sigma_* = 
    \begin{cases}
        \Sigma_g \tau_{\rm EB}^{-1}, & \Sigma_g \geq \Sigma_{g,2} \\
        \Sigma_g \tau_{\rm EB}^{-1} \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,2}}\Big)^{2.6}, & \Sigma_{g,1} \leq \Sigma_g \leq \Sigma_{g,2} \\
        \Sigma_g \tau_{\rm EB}^{-1} \Big(\frac{\Sigma_{g,1}}{\Sigma_{g,2}}\Big)^{2.6} \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,1}}\Big)^{0.7}, & \Sigma_g \leq \Sigma_{g,1},
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-sfr}
\end{equation}
with $\Sigma_{g,1}=5\times 10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}$ and $\Sigma_{g,2}=2\times 10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm kpc}^{-2}$.

\paragraph{Two-infall} [Expand]
We parameterize the infall rate as two successive, exponentially declining bursts as in \citet{Chiappini2001-AbundanceGradients}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:twoinfall-ifr}
    f_{\rm TI}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = N_1(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-t/\tau_1} + N_2(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-(t-t_{\rm on})/\tau_2}
\end{equation}
In this model, the first infall produces the thick disk and the second infall produces the thin disk. The normalization ratio $N_2/N_1$ is calculated so that the thick-to-thin-disk surface density ratio $f_\Sigma(R)=\Sigma_2(R)/\Sigma_1(R)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    f_\Sigma(R) = f_\Sigma(0) e^{R(1/R_2 - 1/R_1)}.
\end{equation}
Following \citet{BlandHawthornGerhard2016-MilkyWayReview}, we adopt values for the thick disk scale radius $R_1=2.0$ kpc, thin disk scale radius $R_2=2.5$ kpc, and $f_\Sigma(0)=0.27$.

\subsection{Observational Sample}
\label{sec:observational-sample}

We compare our simulation results to abundance measurements from the final data release \citep[DR17;][]{Abdurro'uf2022-SDSSIV-DR17} of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE;][]{Majewski2017-APOGEE}. APOGEE used infrared spectrographs \citep{Wilson2019-APOGEE-Spectrographs} mounted on two telescopes: the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope \citep{Gunn2006-SloanTelescope} at Apache Point Observatory, United States in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Ir{\'e}n{\'e}e DuPont Telescope \citep{BowenVaughan1973-DuPontTelescope} at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile in the Southern Hemisphere. After the spectra were passed through the data reduction pipeline \citep{Nidever2015-APOGEE-DataReduction}, the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline \citep[ASPCAP;][]{Holtzmann2015-ASPCAP,GarciaPerez2016-ASPCAP} extracted chemical abundances using the model grids and interpolation method described by \citet{Jonsson2020-APOGEE-DR16}.

We restrict our sample to red giant branch and red clump stars with high-quality spectra. Table \ref{tab:sample-selection} lists our selection criteria, which largely follow from \citet{Hayden2015-ChemicalCartography}. This produces a final sample of \variable{output/sample_size.txt}stars. APOGEE stars are matched with their Bailer-Jones photo-geometric distance estimate from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 \citep{Gaia2016-Mission,Gaia2021-EDR3}, which we use to calculate galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gal}$ and midplane distance $z$.
We use estimated ages from \citet{Leung2023-Ages} (hereafter \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages}), who use a variational encoder-decoder network to retrieve age estimates for APOGEE giants without contamination from age-abundance correlations. Importantly, the \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} sample does not experience the $\sim10$ Gyr plateau that affects ages from astroNN \citep{Mackereth2019-astroNN-Ages}. We use an age uncertainty cut of 40\% per the recommendations of \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages}, which produces a total sample of \variable{output/age_sample_size.txt}APOGEE stars with age estimates. The median uncertainty in log-age space is $\sim 0.1$.

\section{Results from One-Zone Models}
\label{sec:onezone-results}

% [Intro paragraph, motivation for running one-zone models]
Before running the full multi-zone simulations, it will be useful to observe the effects of the DTD in more idealized conditions. A one-zone model assumes the entire gas reservoir is instantaneously mixed, so there is no spatial dependence for the distribution of metal abundances. In this section 

All models are run for a duration of $t_{\rm max}=13.2$ Gyr with a time-step of $\Delta t=0.01$ Gyr. We adopt the inside-out SFR (Equation \ref{eq:insideout-sfh}) evaluated at $R_{\rm gal}=8$ kpc (i.e., $\tau_{\rm rise}=2$ Gyr and $\tau_{\rm sfh}=15.1$ Gyr), an SFE timescale $\tau_*\equiv M_g/\dot M_*=2$ Gyr, and an initial gas mass $M_{g,0}=0$. We adopt a continuous recycling prescription \citep[see Equation 2 from][]{JohnsonWeinberg2020-Starbursts}. Unless otherwise specified, we adopt an outflow mass-loading factor $\eta\equiv \dot M_{\rm out}/\dot M_*=2.15$ \citepalias[see Equation 8 from][]{Johnson2021-Migration} and a minimum SN Ia delay time of 40 Myr. A summary of these one-zone fiducial parameters is presented in Table \ref{tab:onezone-parameters}.

\end{deluxetable}

The left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel} compares the results of three one-zone models which are identical except for the slope of the power-law DTD. A steeper slope produces a sharper ``knee'' and a faster decline in [O/Fe], resulting in a narrower distribution of [O/Fe] around the low-$\alpha$ sequence and a dearth of high-$\alpha$ stars. Conversely, a shallower slope produces a gentler knee and slower decline in [O/Fe], resulting in a broader [O/Fe] distribution and a greater number of high-$\alpha$ stars. In all cases the [O/Fe] distribution is distinctly unimodal. The distribution of [Fe/H] is not as strongly affected by the power-law slope: a shallower slope results in only a modest increase in the width of the distribution.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/onezone_threepanel.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Left:} Abundance tracks in the [Fe/H]--[O/Fe] plane for one-zone chemical evolution models models which assume a power-law DTD. The dotted, dashed, and solid curves represent models with power-law slopes $\alpha=-0.8$, $-1.1$, and $-1.4$, respectively. For reference, the solid gray curve represents an exponential DTD with $\tau=3$ Gyr. In all cases a minimum SN Ia delay time of 40 Myr is assumed. The open symbols located along each curve mark logarithmic steps in simulation time. The marginal panels above and to the right of the central panel present the distributions of [Fe/H] and [O/Fe], respectively. For display purposes, these distributions are convolved with a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 0.02 dex.
    \textit{Middle:} Similar, comparing exponential DTDs with varying timescales. The solid, dashed, and dotted curves represent timescales $\tau=6$, 3, and 1.5 Gyr, respectively.
    \textit{Right:} Similar, comparing plateau DTDs with varying plateau widths. The solid, dashed, and dotted green curves represent widths $W=1$, 0.3, and 0.1 Gyr, respectively. All plateau DTD models assume a post-plateau power-law slope of $\alpha=-1.1$. For reference, the solid gray curve represents an exponential DTD with $\tau=3$ Gyr, and the dotted purple curve represents a power-law DTD with $\alpha=-1.1$ and no plateau.}
    \label{fig:onezone-threepanel}
    \script{onezone_threepanel.py}
\end{figure*}

Similar trends can be seen when adjusting the timescale of the exponential DTD, as shown in the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel}. Here, the knee is not a sharp feature associated with the onset of SNe Ia as in the power-law case, but rather a gentle curve in the abundance track around a simulation time of 1 Gyr. A short exponential timescale shifts this knee down to lower [O/Fe] values, while a longer timescale raises it. The effect on the [O/Fe] distribution is similar to the power-law slope: a short timescale produces more low-$\alpha$ stars, while a long timescale produces more high-$\alpha$ stars (but still a unimodal distribution). The effect on the [Fe/H] distribution is somewhat more pronounced, with longer timescales skewing to lower [Fe/H] values. A doubling of the timescale from 1.5 Gyr to 3 Gyr raises the [O/Fe] abundance ratio at $t=1$ Gyr by $\sim0.05$ dex and at $t=3$ Gyr by $\sim0.1$ dex, but the equilibrium abundance reached at $t=10$ Gyr remains unchanged. For all exponential models, the low-$\alpha$ peak sits approximately 0.02 dex lower than for the power-law models.

Finally, the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel} shows the effect of the plateau DTD model width on abundance tracks and distributions. The effect on the [O/Fe] distribution is similar to the previous two models: a longer plateau raises the median delay time, resulting in a smaller low-$\alpha$ peak and a more prominent high-$\alpha$ tail. The abundance tracks from several different plateau widths fill the space in between the exponential ($\tau=3$ Gyr) and power-law ($\alpha=-1.1$ with no plateau) models, which are both included in the panel for reference. The abundance track from the plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) model is nearly identical to the exponential ($\tau=3$ Gyr), although the [O/Fe] distributions are somewhat more distinct.

One parameter of the DTD which we hold fixed in the multi-zone models is the minimum SN Ia delay time $t_D$. Typical choices for $t_D$ in the literature range from $\sim 40$ Myr to 150 Myr. The left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel} shows that the minimum SN Ia delay time has a much stronger effect on the abundance track and MDFs of models which assume a power-law DTD than models which assume a plateau or exponential DTD, due to the much higher SN Ia rate in the power-law models at early times (see Figure \ref{fig:dtds}). Moreover, a power-law DTD with a long minimum delay may be observationally hard to distinguish from a plateau model. In Figure \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel}, the abundance track for the model with a power-law DTD and $t_D=150$ Myr (dashed purple line) is similar to that of the plateau DTD with $W=0.3$ Gyr and $t_D=40$ Myr (solid green line), and the [O/Fe] distributions are virtually identical. The difference between the two values of $t_D$ for the exponential ($\tau=3$ Gyr) DTD in both the abundance tracks and distributions is nearly indistinguishable. We do not consider the effect on the other DTD models because a 150 Myr minimum delay time is incompatible with the two-population model, which has $\sim 50$\% of SNe Ia explode in the first 100 Myr, and would have a negligible effect on the triple-system DTD due to its low SN Ia rate at short delay times.

The layout is similar to the plots in Figure \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel}. For clarity, we assume a mass-loading factor $\eta=1$ for the exponential DTD curves.

The choice of DTD primarily affects the location of the high-$\alpha$ ``knee'' in the [Fe/H]--[O/Fe] abundance tracks. At one extreme is the triple-system model, which sees the CC SN plateau extend up to ${\rm [Fe/H]}\approx0.8$ followed by a sharp downward turn as the SN Ia rate suddenly increases at a delay time of 500 Myr. Star formation proceeds for such a long time before the knee that the [O/Fe] distribution shows a slight second peak around the CC SN value; this model is the only one which produces any amount of bimodality in the one-zone simulations. At the other extreme are the two-population and power-law ($\alpha=-1.1$) models which peak immediately after the minimum delay time of 40 Myr, placing the knee at ${\rm [Fe/H]}\approx-1.8$. The two-population model has a unique second knee at ${\rm [Fe/H]}\approx-0.2$ and ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx0.1$, which is a result of the delayed exponential component. The abundance tracks from the plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) and exponential ($\tau=1.5$ Gyr) models lie in the intermediate space between these extremes. On the other hand, the [O/Fe] distribution from the exponential model is the most strongly peaked at the Solar value, while the plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) and triple-system models produce nearly identical distributions in the low-$\alpha$ regime. The exponential ($\tau=3$ Gyr) and plateau ($W=0.3$ Gyr) models, while not shown, produce similar abundance tracks to the plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) and exponential ($\tau=1.5$ Gyr) models, respectively.

[Summary and conclusions from one-zone models]

% \subsection{The Star Formation History}

% Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar} shows results from one-zone models with a power-law DTD which differ in their assumed minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$) or star formation efficiency timescale ($\tau_*$). In [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space, doubling or halving the minimum delay time produces similar results to doubling or halving the SFE timescale. A shorter minimum delay time means SNe Ia will start to explode sooner after the star formation burst, giving less time for CCSNe to explode at the plateau of the abundance track. Similarly, a longer SFE timescale means fewer massive stars will be produced by the initial star formation burst, resulting in fewer CCSNe before the first SNe Ia explode. 

% The minimum delay and SFE timescale have similar effects on the abundance tracks but very different effects on the MDFs. Altering the SFE timescale changes the stellar distribution of [Fe/H], especially at the low-metallicity end, as shown in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. However, as a change in the SFE timescale affects both the number of high-mass and low-mass stars produced, it does not affect the distribution of [O/Fe], as shown in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. Meanwhile, a change in the minimum SN Ia delay time does not impact the total number of SNe which explode, so the distribution of [Fe/H] is largely unaffected, while it does result in a change in the number of high-$\alpha$ stars formed and therefore the distribution of [O/Fe].

\subsection{The distribution of [Fe/H]}

Figure \ref{fig:feh-df-comparison} shows MDFs across the Galaxy for a selection of models and APOGEE data. The two left-hand columns show MDFs from our simulations which assume the same DTD (exponential with $\tau=1.5$ Gyr) but different model SFHs. For comparison, the APOGEE MDFs are binned similarly and presented in the center column of Figure \ref{fig:feh-df-comparison}. 

Holding the SFH fixed, varying the DTD has a very minor effect on the MDF across the disk. The two right-hand columns of Figure \ref{fig:feh-df-comparison} plot the MDFs for two multi-zone simulations which both assume an inside-out SFH but different DTDs: a power-law with slope $\alpha=-1.4$, and an exponential with timescale $\tau=3$ Gyr. The balance between prompt and delayed SNe Ia is starkly different between the two models, with $\sim 80\%$ of SNe Ia exploding within 1 Gyr in the former model but only $\sim 30\%$ in the latter.

The choice of DTD and SFH has a larger effect on the inner regions of the galaxy than the outer. Inner regions have a higher SFR and more stars are formed at early times than late, so differences in the SN Ia rate have a more pronounced effect on the MDF. For all SFH models except two-infall, the outer galaxy has a longer SFR timescale than the inner galaxy, so the MDF in the outer galaxy is relatively unaffected by the fraction of prompt SNe Ia.

While there are some quantitative differences in how the shape of the MDF varies with Galactic region, the qualitative trends are unaffected by the choice of model SFH or DTD. These trends are primarily driven by chemical equilibrium, abundance gradients, and radial migration \citepalias[][see their Section 3.2 for further discussion]{Johnson2021-Migration}.

\subsection{The distribution of [O/Fe]}

The distribution of [O/Fe] serves as a record of the relative rates of SNe Ia and CCSNe. As such, the shape of the distribution is greatly affected by both the SFH and DTD. Figure \ref{fig:ofe-df-sfh} shows the distribution of [O/Fe] across the disk for the four model SFHs, all assuming an exponential DTD with $\tau=1.5$ Gyr, compared to the distributions measured by APOGEE. We see similar trends with Galactic region across all four simulations. Near the midplane, the distributions at the innermost and outermost annuli are similar, but away from the midplane, there is a clear trend of a higher average stellar [O/Fe] at small $R_{\rm gal}$ and lower [O/Fe] at large $R_{\rm gal}$.

While trends with $R_{\rm gal}$ and $|z|$ are similar, the shape of the distribution varies greatly with the chosen SFH. The inside-out and late-burst models produce similar distributions because of the similarity of their underlying SFHs \textemdash both skew heavily toward near-Solar [O/Fe], although the late-burst model produces a slightly broader peak and a less-prominent high-[O/Fe] tail. The only region which shows any significant skew toward high [O/Fe] is $R_{\rm gal}=3-5$ kpc and $|z|=1-2$ kpc, but the shift to higher [O/Fe] at high latitudes is gradual and does not produce the notable trough at ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx0.2$ which is seen in the APOGEE data. 

On the other hand, the early-burst model produces a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe] even out to large radii and close to the midplane, whereas the APOGEE distribution does not show a prominent high-$\alpha$ peak beyond $R_{\rm{Gal}}\sim11$ kpc. 
The early-burst SFH produces the closest match to the data by far: the low-$\alpha$ sequence away from the midplane shows increasing contribution with larger radii, with the innermost radii containing very few low-$\alpha$ stars. However, the high-$\alpha$ sequence contains substantial contribution from stars at large radii, which is not seen in the data.

The two-infall SFH model produces \textit{three} distinct modes at ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx 0.0$, $0.2$, and $0.4$. At small $R_{\rm gal}$ and with increasing $|z|$, the low-$\alpha$ peak decreases in prominence and the high-$\alpha$ peak increases, but the intermediate peak is a striking feature at all latitudes which is at odds with the APOGEE data.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/ofe_df_sfh.pdf}
    \caption{Distributions of [O/Fe] from multi-zone simulations with different SFHs. In all cases an exponential DTD with timescale $\tau=1.5$ Gyr is assumed. The format of each panel is the same as in Figure \ref{fig:feh-df-comparison}, except that all distributions are smoothed with a box-car width of 0.05 dex. Distributions from APOGEE DR17, binned and smoothed similarly, are presented in the right-most column for reference.}

    \script{ofe_df_sfh.py}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:ofe-df-dtd} shows [O/Fe] distributions produced by simulations with the same SFH but a range of different DTDs. We choose the early-burst SFH because it produces distinct high- and low-$\alpha$ sequences, which makes the effect of the DTD on the former more apparent. The most apparent effect of the DTD is to shift the mode of the high-$\alpha$ sequence. The two-population DTD, which has the most prompt SNe Ia of any model in this paper, places the high-$\alpha$ sequence at ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx 0.2$, while the triple-system DTD, which has the fewest prompt SNe Ia, places it $\sim0.2$ dex higher at ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx0.4$. This metric alone would seem to favor the exponential ($\tau=1.5$ Gyr) or plateau ($W=0.3$ Gyr; not shown) models; however,

\subsection{Bimodality in [O/Fe]}
\label{sec:bimodality}

A striking feature of the [O/Fe] distribution in the Milky Way is the distinct separation into two components, the high- and low-$\alpha$ sequences. 

Reference \citet{Vincenzo2021-AlphaDistribution} for how the bimodality is made stronger by the selection function, but it's not just due to selection effects.

\subsection{The [O/Fe]--[Fe/H] Plane}
\label{sec:ofe-feh}

[Subsection introduction]
Section \ref{sec:onezone-results} and specifically Figures \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel} and \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel} illustrated the effect of the DTD models and parameters on [O/Fe]--[Fe/H] tracks in idealized one-zone models.

Figure \ref{fig:ofe-feh-sfh} compares the [O/Fe]--[Fe/H] plane in the Solar neighborhood ($7\leq R_{\rm gal}<9$ kpc, $0\leq|z|<0.5$ kpc) between our four model SFHs. All simulations presented in this figure assume an exponential DTD model with $\tau=1.5$ Gyr, as it lies in the middle in terms of balance between prompt and delayed SNe Ia. The black curves represent the ISM abundance as a function of time in the central zone; in the absence of radial migration, all simulated stellar populations would lie along these lines. Stars to the left of the abundance tracks were born in the outer disk, while stars to the right of the tracks were born in the inner disk, as evidenced by the color-coding in the figure.

The inside-out and late-burst models produce similar results, the main difference being a slightly broader core of the abundance distribution around ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx0.05$ dex. The Gaussian burst in SFH in the late-burst model introduces a loop in the ISM abundance track, where an uptick in star formation at $t\approx11$ Gyr raises the CCSN rate, leading to a slight increase in [O/Fe] before the subsequent increase in the SN Ia rate brings it back down. This same pattern is seen much more strongly in the abundance tracks for the two-infall model: here, the significant infall of pristine gas at $t=4$ Gyr leads to rapid dilution of the ISM, followed by a large burst in the SFR which raises [O/Fe] by $\sim 0.2$ dex. In this case the second infall produces a ``ridge line'' in the abundance distribution at ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx 0.2$. Finally, the early-burst model shows the clearest separation between a high-[O/Fe] track which follows the ISM abundance from low metallicities, and a low-[O/Fe] sequence composed of stars with a wide range of birth radii. The early-burst model sees a higher density of points which closely follow the ISM track at ${\rm [Fe/H]}\lesssim 0.5$ which is likely the result of an increased SFR at early times relative to the other models.

    \includegraphics{figures/ofe_feh_sfh.pdf}

A Gaussian scatter has been applied to all points based on the median abundance errors in APOGEE DR17 (ses Table \ref{tab:uncertainties}). The black curves represent the ISM abundance tracks in the 8 kpc zone. The red contours represent a 2-D kernel density estimate with a bandwidth of 0.03 of the APOGEE abundance distribution in that Galactic region, with the solid and dashed contours enclosing 30\% and 80\% of stars in the sample, respectively.}

    \script{ofe_feh_sfh.py}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ofe-feh-dtd} compares [O/Fe]--[Fe/H] distributions for five simulations with the same SFH (inside-out) but different DTD models. We choose the inside-out SFH model for this figure because it produces a monotonically-decreasing abundance track, making comparisons between the different DTD models relatively straightforward. We note that in this model, both the low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences are composed of stars with a wide range of birth $R_{\rm gal}$. The simulation results are arranged by increasing median delay time from left to right. Results for the two-population and power-law ($\alpha=-1.1$) DTD models, with a large fraction of prompt SNe Ia, are presented in the first and second columns, respectively. For these models, the simulated stellar abundances are reasonably well-aligned with the APOGEE contours at low $|z|$ (bottom panels), but they entirely miss the observed high-$\alpha$ sequence at high $|z|$ (top panels). In the center column, the exponential ($\tau=1.5$ Gyr) DTD produces a distribution which aligns quite well with the APOGEE contours in all $|z|$-bins, and even produces a ``ridge'' which extends to large [O/Fe] at low- and mid-latitudes (bottom and center panels, respectively). While it does better at populating the high-$\alpha$ sequence than the previous DTD models, the bulk of the simulated populations at large $|z|$ still fall below the APOGEE 30\% contour (top panel). The two right-hand columns present simulation results for the plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) and triple-system DTD models, which have the longest median delay times. The high-$\alpha$ ``knee'' occurs at a much higher metallicity in these models and is visible in the gas abundance tracks in the upper-left corner of the panels. At high $|z|$, the simulated abundance align quite well with the APOGEE high-$\alpha$ sequence (top panels), but there is a significant ridge of high-$\alpha$ stars from the inner Galaxy at low $|z|$ (bottom panels).

\subsection{The Age--[O/Fe] Plane}
\label{sec:age-ofe}

[Subsection introduction]

Figure \ref{fig:age-ofe-sfh} compares the stellar age and [O/Fe] distributions in the Solar neighborhood between our four SFH models. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:ofe-feh-sfh}, all four panels assume an exponential DTD model with $\tau=1.5$ Gyr. We include age data from \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} for qualitative comparison, though we caution against drawing strong conclusions because we don't correct for selection effects or systematics in the neural net ages. The inside-out and late-burst models show fair agreement with the data at high [O/Fe], although both show a $\sim2$ Gyr offset to older ages. One could shift the ramp-up in star formation to slightly later times or simply run the simulation for a shorter amount of time to close this gap. Like the data, the trend in the median age with decreasing [O/Fe] decreases monotonically in the inside-out model. The late-burst model, however, shows a bump in the distribution around a lookback time of $\sim2$ Gyr driven by the Gaussian SFR burst, which is not seen in the data, as noted by \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}. Neither model produces a significant amount of stars below Solar [O/Fe], in contrast to the data.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/age_ofe_sfh.pdf}
    \caption{A comparison of the age--[O/Fe] relation between multi-zone simulations with different SFH models. All assume an exponential DTD with $\tau=1.5$ Gyr. Each panel plots a random mass-weighted sample of 10,000 star particles in the Solar neighborhood ($7\leq R_{\rm gal}<9$ kpc, $0\leq|z|<0.5$ kpc) color-coded by the Galactocentric radius at birth. A Gaussian scatter has been applied to all points based on the median [O/Fe] error from APOGEE DR17 and the median age error from \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} (see Table \ref{tab:uncertainties}). Black squares represent the mass-weighted median age of star particles within bins of [O/Fe] with a width of 0.05 dex, and the horizontal black error bars encompass the 16th and 84th percentiles. Red triangles represent the median age from \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} in bins of [O/Fe], and the horizontal red error bars encompass the 16th and 84th percentiles. For clarity, bins which contain less than 1\% of the total mass (in the simulations) or total number of stars (in the data) are not plotted.}
    \label{fig:age-ofe-sfh}
    \script{age_ofe_sfh.py}
\end{figure}

For the early-burst SFH model, the simulated stellar ages are almost perfectly aligned with the data for ${\rm [O/Fe]}\gtrsim 0.2$. The rapid rise in the SFE at early times delays the descent to lower [O/Fe] values and produces a clump of low-metallicity, high-[O/Fe] stars at an age of $\sim10$ Gyr. The early-burst model produces a sharp transition between a linear relationship between [O/Fe] and age for stars older than $\sim5$ Gyr and a flat relationship for the younger stars, and it too misses the lowest [O/Fe] bin in the data. Finally, the two-infall SFH model produces the closest overall agreement between the simulated and observed median ages. Stars with ${\rm [O/Fe]}\gtrsim 0.25$ were produced in the first infall, while the second infall produces a clump of stars with similar metallicity, ages of $\sim8$ Gyr, and ${\rm [O/Fe]}\approx0.2$. There is an interesting small population of very old, low-$\alpha$ stars which is not seen in any of the other models. The two-infall model is the only one which plateaus at sub-Solar [O/Fe] for the youngest stars, leading to a very good match to the observed data at low [O/Fe].

Figure \ref{fig:age-ofe-dtd} similarly plots the simulated distributions in age--[O/Fe] space for five of our DTD models. All simulations were run with the early-burst SFH model because the high-$\alpha$ sequence was distinct in metallicity space in Figure \ref{fig:age-ofe-sfh}. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:ofe-feh-dtd}, simulations are arranged from left to right by increasing median SN Ia delay time. Moving from left to right, the high-$\alpha$ sequence moves to higher [O/Fe] with increasing median delay time, from $\sim0.4$ for the two-population model to $\sim0.4$ for the triple-system DTD. As we have seen in previous figures, the range in [O/Fe] produced by the models on the left is much smaller than for the models on the right. At high $|z|$ (top row), the observed range of [O/Fe] is larger than produced by any of our simulations, although the plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) and triple-system models come close. While the other three fall short of the observed range in [O/Fe], they more closely match the median age--[O/Fe] relation. There is a slight reversal in the observed trend for the stars with the highest [O/Fe]: the $0.45\leq{\rm [O/Fe]}<0.5$ bin has a slightly \textit{lower} median age than the $0.3\leq{\rm [O/Fe]}<0.35$ bin at high $|z|$ in the \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} sample, a small effect but one which is not observed in any of our simulation results.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/age_ofe_dtd.pdf}
    \caption{A comparison of the age--[O/Fe] relation between multi-zone simulations with different DTD models. All assume the early-burst SFH. Each row contains star particles from a different bin in $|z|$, with stars closest to the midplane in the bottom row and stars farthest from the midplane in the top row. In all panels stars are limited to the Solar annulus ($7\leq R_{\rm gal}<9$ kpc), and the layout of each panel is as in Figure \ref{fig:age-ofe-sfh}.}
    \label{fig:age-ofe-dtd}
    \script{age_ofe_dtd.py}
\end{figure*}

Moving to stars at low $|z|$, our plateau ($W=1$ Gyr) and triple-system DTDs over-produce stars at the old, high-$\alpha$ end of the distribution, while also diverging significantly from the observed sequence near solar [O/Fe]. The exponential ($\tau=1.5$ Gyr) DTD comes closest to reproducing the observed range in [O/Fe], while the two DTDs with the shortest median delay time once again produce a smaller range of [O/Fe] than observed. We note that the break between the linear and flat parts of the relation is sharpest for the exponential DTD, and a more gradual transition is observed for the other four DTD models. This could be because the exponential DTD is most dominant at intermediate delay times ($\tau\sim 1-3$ Gyr) but falls off much faster than the other models at long delay times, so the evolution of [O/Fe] is quite slow for lookback times $\lesssim 5$ Gyr. Overall, the exponential ($\tau=1.5$ Gyr) DTD most closely matches the data for stars with $0\leq|z|<1$ kpc.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Scoring the Model Outputs}
\label{sec:scores}

The results presented in Section \ref{sec:multizone-results} represent a fraction of the total model outputs. We ran models for four different SFHs and eight different DTDs, for a combined total of 32 model runs. While we focused our attention on results in the Solar annulus (for which we still have the best data), we have model outputs which span the entire disk out to 20 kpc. In order to identify trends among our many models, it will be useful to have some semi-quantitative way to compare their outputs to APOGEE data across the disk.

We compare our multi-zone outputs to APOGEE across five diagnostics: the [Fe/H] DF, [O/Fe] DF, [Fe/H]--[O/Fe] plane, age--[O/Fe] plane, and [O/Fe] bimodality. We perform statistical tests between APOGEE and simulation outputs in each region of the galaxy, then average the scores together (weighted by the number of APOGEE targets in each galactic region) to obtain a single numerical score for each simulation. Note that we are not trying to use these scores to fit our models to the data, nor are we trying to rule out any SFH in general. We use these scores to get a handle on which combinations of SFH and DTD are favorable or disfavorable in certain regimes. 

To quantify the difference between the abundance distributions (MDFs and [O/Fe] DFs) generated by VICE and those observed in APOGEE, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence \citep{KullbackLeibler1951}, defined as
\begin{equation}
    D_{\rm{KL}}(P \parallel Q) \equiv \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\Big(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\Big) dx
    \label{eq:kl-divergence}
\end{equation}
for distributions $P$ and $Q$ with probability density functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. A KL divergence of 0 indicates that the two distributions contain equal amounts of information. In this case, $P$ is the APOGEE DF, $Q$ is the model DF, and $x$ is either [Fe/H] or [O/Fe]. For each model SFH and DTD, we compute $D_{\rm{KL}}$ in 18 different Galactocentric regions: 2 kpc-wide bins in $R_{\rm gal}$ between 3 and 15 kpc, and bins in $|z|$ of $0-0.5$ kpc, $0.5-1$ kpc, and $1-2$ kpc. The KL divergence for the entire model is taken to be the average of $D_{\rm{KL}}$ for each region weighted by the number of APOGEE stars in that region.

\citet{PerezCruz2008-KLTest2D} present a method for estimating the KL divergence between two continuous, multivariate samples using a $k$-nearest neighbor estimate. We implement this method to calculate the divergence between the multi-zone models and APOGEE data in [Fe/H]---[O/Fe] space.\footnote{We got the implementation from \url{https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scipy-user/2011-May/029521.html}.}

We employ a different test in the age---[O/Fe] plane. [motivated by the large age uncertainties?] As shown in Figures \ref{fig:age-ofe-sfh} and \ref{fig:age-ofe-dtd}, in each Galactic region we bin the model outputs and data into bins of [O/Fe] with a width of 0.05 dex. We define the RMS median age difference for the region as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta\tau_{\rm RMS} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\sum_k \Delta\tau_k^2 n_{{\rm L23},k}}{n_{\rm L23,tot}}}
    \label{eq:age-ofe-score}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\tau_k=\rm{med}(\tau_{\rm VICE})-\rm{med}(\tau_{\rm L23})$ is the difference between the mass-weighted median star particle age in VICE and the median stellar age from \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} in bin $k$, $n_{{\rm L23},k}$ is the number of stars from the \citetalias{Leung2023-Ages} age sample in bin $k$, and $n_{\rm L23,tot}$ is the total number of stars in the sample in that Galactic region. As before, the score for the model as a whole is the average of $\Delta \tau_{\rm RMS}$ across all regions, weighted by the number of stars in the age sample in each region.

The results of these tests are presented in Table \ref{tab:results}. Instead of reporting the numerical scores for each simulation output, in the column corresponding to a particular diagnostic we simply write \yes, \meh, or \no, which corresponds to a score in the top, middle, or bottom tirtile out of all of our simulations, respectively. A \yes indicates that particular combination of model SFH and DTD performed better than most when compared to the APOGEE sample for that diagnostic.

\subsection{The Two-Infall SFH Model}

[Compare to previous studies]
Discuss \citet{Matteucci2006-BimodalDTDConsequences} findings of the \citet{Mannucci2006-TwoPopulations} DTD in the two-infall model.

\citet{Poulhazan2018-PrecisionPollution} found that DTD models with a significant prompt component (power-law and two-population) produced the highest average stellar abundance of [O/Fe]. They also found that these models produced the narrowest [O/Fe] distributions and suppressed the long tail to low [O/Fe] ratios. Conversely, their models with essentially 0 prompt SNe Ia produced a lower average stellar [O/Fe] ratio at late times and a broader distribution of [O/Fe]. Their isolated galaxy simulations have an SFR which features an early ($<1$ Gyr) burst followed by a roughly exponential decline, qualitatively similar to our early-burst model but with the peak of star formation occuring $\sim3$ Gyr earlier. We note that their simulations were not designed to reproduce a Milky Way-like galaxy; as such, their [O/Fe] distributions peak around $\sim0.45$ which is higher than the APOGEE high-$\alpha$ sequence. Nevertheless, our study reproduces their finding that a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia will produce a narrower distribution of [O/Fe]. One exception to this is the exponential DTD, which has a marginally narrower distribution than the power-law DTD close to the midplane [numbers here] but a more prominent hith-$\alpha$ tail. This is likely a consequence of the fact that the exponential DTD has a much lower SN Ia rate at late times ($\sim10$ Gyr) than other models [expand on this].

\citet{Palicio2023-AnalyticDTD} compare seven different DTDs, including the analytical SD, DD-WIDE, and DD-CLOSE, as well as the empirical two-population and $t^{-1}$ power-law DTDs, in a one-zone model with a two-infall SFH. [Note that they use some different parameters for the analytical models than we do). Critically for our purposes, and in contrast to previous studies of the two-infall model \citep[e.g.,][others]{Chiappini1997-TwoInfall,Spitoni2021-TwoInfall}, the authors include the effects of outflows, although they explore mass-loading values of $\eta=0.2-0.8$ which is significantly lower than in our simulations.

[Metallicity dependent DTD]

[Is the MW DTD the same as elsewhere?]
\citet{Walcher2016-SelfSimilarity} argue that the similarity of the age--[$\alpha$/Fe] relation between Solar neighborhood stars and nearby elliptical galaxies is evidence for a universal DTD; between a bimodal, narrow Gaussian, and power-law DTD, they find the latter best explains their data.

\subsection{Radial Migration \& Bimodality}

One curious chemical feature of the Milky Way disk is the existence of two populations separated by their \aFe abundance ratios at similar metallicity \citep[e.g.,][]{Bensby2014-SolarNeighborhoodAbundances}. 

% Taken from introduction
The bimodal distribution of \aFe in stars with similar metallicities was first noted in the Solar neighborhood \citep[e.g.,][]{Furhmann1998-NearbyStars}, later extended to the whole of the Milky Way disk \citep{Nidever2014-ChemicalEvolutionAPOGEE,Hayden2015-ChemicalCartography}. The ``high-$\alpha$'' population contains stars with low enrichment from SNe Ia, so their abundance ratios reflect that of almost pure CCSN enrichment; it is associated with the kinematically hot thick disk \citep{Bensby2003-AbundanceTrends}. The ``low-$\alpha$'' population is associated with the thin disk and contains stars with roughly solar $\alpha$-abundances.
Various explanations of the \aFe bimodality have been proposed, including radial stellar mixing \citep{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing} and a bursty gas infall history \citep[e.g.,][]{Spitoni2021-TwoInfall}.
% The origin of the \aFe bimodality is debated. \citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing} argue that it arises due to radial migration (churning) even with a smooth SFR. \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration} use a smooth SFR and a prescription for radial migration but are unable to reproduce the bimodality. \citet{Spitoni2021-TwoInfall} (definitely earlier papers too) argue that two distinct infall episodes can explain the bimodality. 
What separates the two sequences is the ratio of CCSN to SN Ia enrichment, so the DTD ought to have some impact on the \aFe bimodality, perhaps even determining whether or not it exists.

% Taken from introduction
A complicating factor in observing and modeling the effects of the DTD is the migration of stars throughout the disk. \citet{SellwoodBinney2002-RadialMixing} first demonstrated that a transient spiral perturbation (or other potential feature; see [citations]) can cause resonant interactions which adjust stars' guiding center radii without leading to kinematic heating of the disk. Core-collapse SNe explode on timescales of a few Myr, before the progenitor has a chance to migrate far from its birth location. On the other hand, SNe Ia have a broad distribution of delay times and their progenitors can migrate great distances between birth and explosion. The consequence is that SNe Ia can enrich regions of the Galaxy far removed from regions which have experienced a high rate of star formation. Talk about \citet{Scannapieco2005-ChemicalEnrichment}. The first GCE model to incorporate radial mixing was developed by \citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing}, and subsequent studies have incorporated more comprehensive numerical treatments of radial migration and the effect of a central bar \citep[e.g.,][]{Minchev2013-ChemodynamicalEvolution}. In this paper, we follow the treatment by \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, who [describe treatment]. 

\citet{Karapetyan2022-SNIaDistances} find a correlation between the SN Ia light curve decline rate, $\Delta m_{15}$, and the distance between the SN and the star-forming shock front of spiral arms. As this distance is expected to be an indicator of the age of the SN progenitor, such a correlation would suggest that the less-luminous, faster-declining SNe Ia come from an older progenitor population, which would be expected from progenitor models with sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions. A similar study on the {\it radial} migration distance is probably impossible due to the challenges in estimating birth radii even in the Milky Way. It could be interesting to incorporate a SN Ia yield which varies with progenitor age into a GCE model.
[Are there analytic DTDs for a DD progenitor with sub-Chandra explosions?]

Something about \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration} and \citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing}.

We need to constrain DTD or galactic SFH better. With SDSS-V, the latter seems much more achievable.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Our diagnostics consistently favor a DTD with a large fraction of delayed SNe Ia, such as the 3 Gyr exponential, 1 Gyr plateau, or triple system evolution models, over a DTD with a high number of prompt SNe Ia, such as the $t^{-1.4}$ power-law or two-population models. [Discuss the disconnect and/or complement with \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD}, etc.; something about different timescales probed by volumetric surveys vs. us]
    
    \item While the choice of DTD cannot produce a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe], it can affect the shape of the distribution, the ratio of high-$\alpha$ to low-$\alpha$ stars, and the location of the high-$\alpha$ sequence if it exists. The SFH is the critical determining factor in bimodality.

    \item The distribution of [Fe/H] depends strongly on the chosen SFH, but there is only a weak effect from the DTD.

    \item The early-burst SFH model is the only one which produced a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe] across the disk resembling APOGEE, from the models we investigate. [Add: summary of why everything else fails.]

    \item Something about how radial migration can't produce bimodality on its own.

\section{Analytical DTDs}
\label{app:analytical-dtds}

Discuss \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} vs our simple function approximations here?

\citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} derives analytical DTDs for SD and DD progenitor systems from assumptions about binary stellar evolution and outcomes of mass exchange. They find that the parameters which have a large effect on the shape of the DTD are the distribution and range of stellar masses in progenitor systems; the efficiency of accretion in the SD scenario; and the distribution of separations at birth in the DD scenario. The left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:analytical-dtd} shows the analytical DTDs for SD progenitors and two different prescriptions for DD progenitors (``WIDE'' and ``CLOSE''). In the ``WIDE'' scheme, it is assumed that there is a wide distribution of ratios $A/A_0$ of the separation of the DD system to the initial separation of the binary, and that the distributions of $A$ and total mass of the system $m_{\rm DD}$ are independent, so one cannot necessarily predict the total merge time of a system based on its initial parameters. In the ``CLOSE'' scheme, there is assumed to be a narrow distribution of $A/A_0$ and a correlation between $A$ and $m_{\rm DD}$, so the most massive binaries tend to merge quickly and the least massive merge last.

The right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:analytical-dtd} shows the results of one-zone chemical evolution models with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} DTDs. We assume $\eta=2.5$, $\tau_*=2$ Gyr, an inside-out SFH evaluated at a radius of 8 kpc, a continuous recycling approximation, and a minimum SN Ia delay of 40 Myr. We compare the SD, DD WIDE, and DD CLOSE schemes to standard power-law, broken power-law, and exponential DTDs. The SD and DD CLOSE DTDs follow nearly identical tracks in [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H]; however, their distributions on [O/Fe] differ at the low end. The SD DTD follows an exponential with a 1.5 Gyr timescale, whereas the DD CLOSE DTD is well-approximated by a broken power-law with an initial plateau of 300 Myr and a subsequent declining slope of -1.1. The WIDE prescription is likewise best approximated by a broken power-law, but with a longer plateau width of 1 Gyr. In all cases, the difference between the analytical DTD and the nearest broken power-law or exponential is likely too small to be observationally detectable, so in our multi-zone models we implement the more generic functions in lieu of the analytical DTDs.

A multi-zone with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} SD DTD produced nearly identical results to an exponential DTD with a 1.5 Gyr timescale.

\section{Stellar Migration}
\label{app:migration}

For each star particle in VICE, \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration} randomly assign an analogue star particle from \texttt{h277} and adopt its radial migration distance $\Delta R$ and final midplane distance $z$. This allows VICE to adopt a realistic pattern of radial migration without needing to implement its own hydrodynamical simulation. However, in regions where the number of h277 star particles is relatively low, such as at large $R_{\rm gal}$ and small $t$, a single h277 star particle can be assigned as an analogue to multiple VICE stellar populations. These populations will have similar formation and migration histories and consequently similar abundances, which produces unphysical ``clumps'' of stars in the abundance distributions at high latitudes and large radii. 

We fit a Gaussian to the distribution of $\Delta R = R_{\rm final} - R_{\rm initial}$ from the \texttt{h277} output in bins of $R_{\rm initial}$ and age. Each Gaussian is centered at 0 and we find that the scale $\sigma_{\Delta R}$ is best described by the function
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\Delta R} = 1.35\,{\rm kpc} \Big(\frac{R_{\rm form}}{8\,{\rm kpc}}\Big)^{0.61} \Big(\frac{\tau}{1\,{\rm Gyr}}\Big)^{0.33}
    \label{eq:radial-migration}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the age of the star particle. 

We fit a sech$^2$ function \citep{Spitzer1942} to the distribution of midplane distances $z$. Vertical migration away from the midplane does not affect the chemical evolution simulation, but we do use $z$ in our analysis. The probability density function (PDF) of $z$ given some scale height $h_z$ is
\begin{equation}
    {\rm PDF}(z) = \frac{1}{4 h_z} {\rm sech}^2\Big(\frac{z}{2 h_z}\Big)
    \label{eq:sech-pdf}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) is
\begin{equation}
    {\rm CDF}(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z / h_z}}.
    \label{eq:sech-cdf}
\end{equation}
We fit the above function to the distributions of $z$ in h277 in varying bins of $\tau$ and $R_{\rm final}$ and found that $h_z$ is best described by the function
\begin{equation}
    h_z = (0.25\,{\rm kpc}) 
    e^{\frac{\tau-5\,{\rm Gyr}}{7.0\,{\rm Gyr}}}
    e^{\frac{R_{\rm final}-8\,{\rm kpc}}{6.0\,{\rm kpc}}}.
    \label{eq:scale-height}
\end{equation}

When a star particle is created by VICE at initial radius $R_{\rm form}$, we sample its total radial migration distance $\Delta R$ from a Gaussian with a width described by Equation \ref{eq:radial-migration}, and we sample its final midplane distance $z_{\rm final}$ from the distribution described by Equation \ref{eq:sech-pdf} with a width given by Equation \ref{eq:scale-height}. The star particle migrates to its final radius $R_{\rm final}$ in a similar manner to the ``diffusion'' case from \citetalias{Johnson2021-Migration}, but with a time dependence $\propto \Delta t^{1/3}$. This produces distributions of $R_{\rm final}$ and $z_{\rm final}$ which are similar to the analogue migration case for all but the oldest stars. 

\citet{Okalidis2022-AurigaMigration} studied the stellar migration in the Auriga simulations and found that the migration strength had both a dependence on age and formation radius. They also found that in strongly-barred galaxies, the migration is stronger overall but has a slower timestep evolution than diffusion ($\Delta t^{0.5}$).

Figure \ref{fig:radial-migration} compares the distributions of $R_{\rm final}$ in bins of $R_{\rm form}$ and age between the analogue and Gaussian migration schema.

Within each panel, colored curves represent the different age bins, ranging from the youngest stars (dark blue) to the oldest (dark red).
