\begin{abstract}
    Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in one-zone and multi-zone chemical evolution models using the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE). VICE includes a prescription for radial stellar migration in multi-zone models. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the 17th data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the SN Ia DTD has the largest effect on the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio, whereas a DTD with more delayed SNe Ia produces a distribution that is skewed toward higher [$\alpha$/Fe]. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence.

\section{Introduction}

Studies of galactic chemical evolution typically assume a single form for the SN Ia DTD. This is the first comprehensive look at the DTD in a model for GCE which includes the effects of radial migration.

Why radial migration is important for SNe Ia.

Summary of observational studies of the DTD. These studies all assume a particular form for the DTD and fit for the specific parameters. They do not quantitatively favor one form over another (e.g., power-law over exponential).

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{DTD Models}
\label{sec:dtd-models}

We explore five different functional forms for the SN Ia DTD: a power-law, a broken power-law with an initial flat plateau, an exponential, a two-population model, and a model based on triple-system dynamics, with a one or two different parameterizations for each. Figure \ref{fig:dtds} presents these DTDs as a function of time after star formation.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics{figures/delay_time_distributions.pdf}
    \caption{Models of the SN Ia delay time distribution used in this paper. All functions are normalized to $f_{\rm Ia}=1$ at $\tau=1$ Gyr. The black squares represent the DTD recovered for the SDSS-II sample of SNe Ia by \citet{Maoz2012-SloanIIDTD}. The horizontal error bars indicate the time range of each DTD measurement, and the vertical error bars represent the 1$\sigma$ uncertainties.}

\end{figure}

% \citet{Stolger2020-ExponentialDTD} perform maximum likelihood estimations based on the cosmic star formation history and the star formation histories of individual galaxies. In both cases their best fit functions were approximately exponential, though they started with a skew-normal function so could not have ended up with a power law even if they wanted to. They don't actually report the timescale of this exponential, but based on the plots I'd say it's about 1.5 - 2 (1.7?) Gyr. Their best fit parameters make no sense to me as they don't report their units.

\paragraph{Power-law} A simple power law with slope $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = A_\alpha (t/1\,\rm{Gyr})^\alpha
    \label{eq:powerlaw-dtd}
\end{equation}
where $A_\alpha = (\alpha+1)(t_{\rm max}^{\alpha+1} - t_{\rm min}^{\alpha+1})^{-1}$ is the normalization coefficient.
A declining power-law with $\alpha\sim-1$ is a standard assumption in many observational studies of the DTD as well as GCE simulations. \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} obtain a DTD with $\alpha=-1.07\pm0.09$ based on volumetric rates and an assumed cosmic SFH for field galaxies in redshift range $0\leq z\leq 2.25$. \citet{Wiseman2021-DESRates} obtain a similar slope of $\alpha=-1.13\pm0.05$ for field galaxies in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.6$. For galaxy clusters, \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} find a steeper DTD slope of $\alpha=-1.39^{+0.32}_{-0.05}$. \citet{Heringer2019-FieldGalaxyDTD} use a SFH-independent method to constrain the DTD for field galaxies within $0.01<z<0.2$ and find a steeper slope of $\alpha=-1.34^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$.
In this paper, we investigate the cases $\alpha=-1.1$ and $\alpha=-1.4$.

\paragraph{Plateau} A ``plateau'' model consisting of a flat slope of width $W$ followed by a power law decline with normalization $B_W$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        B_W, & t < W \\
        B_W (t/W)^\alpha, & t \ge W
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:plateau-dtd}
\end{equation}
where $B_W=[(W-t_{\rm min}) + \frac{t_{\rm max}^{\alpha+1} - W^{\alpha+1}}{(\alpha+1)W^\alpha}]^{-1}$ is the normalization coefficient.
We investigate the cases $W=0.3$ Gyr and $W=1$ Gyr, taking $\alpha=-1.1$ for all plateau models. Figure \ref{fig:dtd-greggio05} illustrates the similarity between these models and two different treatments of the analytical double-degenerate DTD from \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}.

\paragraph{Exponential} An exponentially declining DTD with timescale $\tau$ and normalization $C_\tau$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = \frac{1}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau}
    \label{eq:exponential-dtd}
\end{equation}
We investigate the case where $\tau=1.5$ Gyr, which has been used in previous studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing,Weinberg2017-ChemicalEquilibrium} and is similar to the analytical single-degenerate DTD from \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}. We also investigate a longer timescale of $\tau=3$ Gyr. \citet{Matteucci1986-SupernovaEnrichment}, \citet{Stolger2020-ExponentialDTD}

\paragraph{Two-population} A DTD in which 50\% of SNe Ia belong to a ``prompt'' Gaussian component at small $t$ and the other 50\% form an exponential tail at large $t$, normalized by $D_{t_p,\sigma,\tau}$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = D_{t_p,\sigma,\tau} \Big[e^{-\frac{(t-t_p)^2}{2\sigma^2}} + e^{-t/\tau}\Big]
    \label{eq:prompt-dtd}
\end{equation}
Following the two-population model from \citet{Mannucci2006-TwoPopulations}, we take $t_p=50$ Myr, $\sigma=15$ Myr, and $\tau=3$ Gyr, which results in roughly 50\% of SNe Ia exploding within $t<100$ Myr.

\paragraph{Triple} A DTD based on simulations of triple-system evolution by \citet{Rajamuthukumar2022-TripleEvolution}. We approximate their DTD as a special case of the plateau model (Equation \ref{eq:plateau-dtd}) where the initial rate is quite low until an instantaneous rise to the plateau value at time $t_{\rm rise}$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \epsilon B_W, & t < t_{\rm rise} \\
        B_W, & t_{\rm rise} \leq t < W \\
        B_W (t / W) ^ \alpha, & t \geq W
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:triple-dtd}
\end{equation}
We take $t_{\rm rise}=0.5$ Gyr, $W=0.5$ Gyr, $\alpha=-1.1$, and $\epsilon=0.05$ so the initial rate is 5\% of the peak rate.

Table \ref{tab:dtds} summarizes the model DTDs we investigate in this paper.

\subsection{Star Formation Histories}
\label{sec:sfh}

In this paper, we consider four models for the SFH: inside-out, late-burst, early-burst, and two-infall. The first two models are run in VICE's ``star formation mode,'' where the surface density of star formation rate $\dot\Sigma_*$ is prescribed along with the star formation efficiency timescale $\tau_*$, and the infall rate surface density $\dot\Sigma_{\rm in}$ and gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ are calculated from the specified quantities. The latter two models are run in ``infall mode,'' where we specify $\dot\Sigma_{\rm in}$  and $\tau_*$ and the other two quantities follow. 

The functions presented below are dimensionless. For a detailed look at the normalization of the star formation rate with $R_{\rm gal}$, we refer the reader to Appendix B of \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}.

\paragraph{Inside-out} Following \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}, this is our fiducial SFH:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm IO}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = (1 - e^{-t/\tau_{\rm rise}}) e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}
    \label{eq:insideout-sfh}
\end{equation}
where we assume $\tau_{\rm rise}=2$ Gyr for all radii. The SFH timescale $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ varies with $R_{\rm gal}$, with $\tau_{\rm sfh}(R_{\rm gal}=8\,\rm{kpc})\approx15$ Gyr at the Solar annulus and longer timescales in the outer galaxy. The $\tau_{\rm sfh} - R_{\rm gal}$ relation is determined from the data of \citet{Sanchez2020-StarFormationTimescales}; see Section 2.5 of \citet{Johnson2021-Migration} for the details.

\paragraph{Late-burst} A variation on the inside-out SFH with a Gaussian burst in the star formation rate:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm LB}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = f_{\rm IO}(t|R_{\rm gal}) \Big(1 + A_b e^{-(t-t_b)^2/2\sigma_b^2} \Big)
    \label{eq:lateburst-sfh}
\end{equation}
where $A_b$ is the dimensionless amplitude of the starburst, $t_b$ is the time of the peak of the burst, and $\sigma_b$ is the width of the Gaussian. Following \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}, we adopt $A_b=1.5$, $t_b=11.2$ Gyr, and $\sigma_b=1$ Gyr. The determination of $\tau_{\rm sfh}$ and the normalization of the SFR as a function of $R_{\rm gal}$ are the same as in the inside-out case.

\paragraph{Early-burst} The infall rate at a given radius declines exponentially with time:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm EB}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = e^{-t/\tau_{\rm sfh}}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-ifr}
\end{equation}
The time-dependence of the SFE timescale $\tau_*$ comes from \citet{Conroy2022-ThickDisk}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tau_*(t|\Sigma_g)}{1\,\rm{Gyr}} =
    \begin{cases}
        50, & t < 2.5\,\rm{Gyr} \\
        \frac{50}{[1+3(t-2.5)]^2}, & 2.5\leq t \leq 3.7\,\rm{Gyr} \\
        2.36, & t > 3.7\,\rm{Gyr}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-conroy22}
\end{equation}
We combine this with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation used by \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}, minus the dependence on the molecular timescale $\tau_{\rm mol}$:
\begin{equation}
    \dot \Sigma_* = 
    \begin{cases}
        \Sigma_g, & \Sigma_g \geq \Sigma_{g,2} \\
        \Sigma_g \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,2}}\Big)^{2.6}, & \Sigma_{g,1} \leq \Sigma_g \leq \Sigma_{g,2} \\
        \Sigma_g \Big(\frac{\Sigma_{g,1}}{\Sigma_{g,2}}\Big)^{2.6} \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,1}}\Big)^{0.7}, & \Sigma_g \leq \Sigma_{g,1}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:kennicutt-schmidt}
\end{equation}
Which leads to an overall SFE timescale of
\begin{equation}
    \tau_*(t,\Sigma_g) = \tau_*(t|\Sigma_g) \frac{\Sigma_g}{\dot \Sigma_*}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-taustar}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Two-infall} 
We parameterize the infall rate as two successive, exponentially declining bursts as in \citet{Chiappini2001-AbundanceGradients}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:twoinfall-ifr}
    f_{\rm TI}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = N_1(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-t/\tau_1} + N_2(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-(t-t_{\rm on})/\tau_2}
\end{equation}
In this model, the first infall produces the thick disk and the second infall produces the thin disk. The normalization ratio $N_2/N_1$ is calculated so that the thick-to-thin-disk surface density ratio $f_\Sigma(R)=\Sigma_2(R)/\Sigma_1(R)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    f_\Sigma(R) = f_\Sigma(0) e^{R(1/R_2 - 1/R_1)}
\end{equation}
where we take the thick disk scale radius $R_1=2.0$ kpc, thin disk scale radius $R_2=2.5$ kpc, and $f_\Sigma(0)=0.27$ following \citet{BlandHawthornGerhard2016-MilkyWayReview}.

Figure \ref{fig:sfhs} presents an overview of these model star formation histories.

In each panel, we plot curves for the zones which have inner radii at 4 kpc (yellow), 6 kpc (orange), 8 kpc (red), 10 kpc (violet), 12 kpc (indigo), and 14 kpc (blue).}

\subsection{Nucleosynthetic Yields}
\label{sec:yields}

Table \ref{tab:yields} summarizes the nucleosynthetic yields assumed in this paper, which we adopt from \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}.

\end{deluxetable}

\subsection{Observational Sample}
\label{sec:observational-sample}

We compare our simulation results to abundance measurements from the 17th data release \citep[DR17;][]{Abdurro'uf2022-SDSSIV-DR17} of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE;][]{Majewski2017-APOGEE}. APOGEE uses infrared spectrographs \citep{Wilson2019-APOGEE-Spectrographs} mounted on two telescopes: the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope \citep{Gunn2006-SloanTelescope} at Apache Point Observatory, United States in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Ir{\'e}n{\'e}e DuPont Telescope \citep{BowenVaughan1973-DuPontTelescope} at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile in the Southern Hemisphere. After the spectra are passed through the data reduction pipeline \citep{Nidever2015-APOGEE-DataReduction}, the APOGEE Stellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline \citep[ASPCAP;][]{Holtzmann2015-ASPCAP,GarciaPerez2016-ASPCAP} extracts chemical abundances using the model grids and interpolation method described by \citet{Jonsson2020-APOGEE-DR16}.

We limit our sample to red giant branch and red clump stars with high-quality spectra; Table \ref{tab:sample-selection} lists our selection criteria, which produce a final sample of \variable{output/sample_size.txt}stars.

    \enddata
\end{deluxetable*}

\subsubsection{Stellar Ages}
\label{sec:stellar-ages}

191,179 stars in our sample have astroNN ages and 71,684 have ages from \citet{Leung2023-Ages}.

% For $19784$ stars, or $\sim3.5\%$ of the sample, the astroNN [Fe/H] abundance estimate is $\gtrsim0.5$ dex lower than the value provided by ASPCAP. The vast majority of these stars are on the lower-main sequence according to \textit{Gaia} photometry, so we exclude stars with $\log(g) > 4$ in ASPCAP. In addition, 197 or $\sim3\%$ of stars with APOKASC-2 asteroseismic ages are reported to be $>5$ Gyr younger by astroNN. The APOKASC-2 age is unphysically high for many of these stars, often exceeding 15 Gyr. We identify prior mass loss as the cause of this discrepancy, so the astroNN ages are likely closer to the truth.

\section{Results from One-Zone Models}
\label{sec:onezone-results}

All models are run for a duration of $t_{\rm max}=13.2$ Gyr with a time-step of $\Delta t=0.01$ Gyr. We adopt an outflow mass-loading factor $\eta\equiv \dot M_{\rm out}/\dot M_*=2.15$ \citep[see Equation 8 from][]{Johnson2021-Migration}, a star formation efficiency timescale $\tau_*\equiv M_{\rm gas}/\dot M_*=2$ Gyr, and an initial gas mass $M_{\rm gas,0}=0$. We adopt a continuous recycling prescription \citep[see Equation 2 from][]{JohnsonWeinberg2020-Starbursts}. Unless otherwise specified, we adopt the inside-out star formation rate (Equation \ref{eq:insideout-sfh}) evaluated at $R_{\rm gal}=8$ kpc (i.e., $\tau_{\rm rise}=2$ Gyr and $\tau_{\rm sfh}=15.1$ Gyr), and a minimum SN Ia delay time of 40 Myr. A summary of these one-zone fiducial parameters is presented in Table \ref{tab:onezone-parameters}.

\subsection{The SN Ia Delay-Time Distribution}
\label{sec:onezone-dtd}

The left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel} compares the results of three one-zone models which are identical except for the slope of the power-law DTD. A steeper slope produces a sharper ``knee'' and a faster decline in [O/Fe], resulting in a narrower distribution of [O/Fe] around the low-$\alpha$ sequence and a dearth of high-$\alpha$ stars. Conversely, a shallower slope produces a gentler knee and slower decline in [O/Fe], resulting in a broader [O/Fe] distribution and a greater number of high-$\alpha$ stars. In all cases the [O/Fe] distribution is distinctly unimodal. The distribution of [Fe/H] is not as strongly affected by the power-law slope: a shallower slope results in only a modest increase in the width of the distribution.

Similar trends can be seen when adjusting the timescale of the exponential DTD, as shown in the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-threepanel}. Here, the knee is not a sharp feature associated with the onset of SNe Ia as in the power-law case, but rather a gentle curve in the abundance track around 1 Gyr. A short exponential timescale shifts this knee down to lower [O/Fe] values, while a longer timescale raises it. The effect on the [O/Fe] distribution is similar to the power-law slope: a short timescale produces more low-$\alpha$ stars, while a long timescale produces more high-$\alpha$ stars (but still a unimodal distribution). The effect on the [Fe/H] distribution is somewhat more pronounced, with longer timescales skewing to lower [Fe/H] values. A doubling of the timescale from 1.5 Gyr to 3 Gyr raises the [O/Fe] abundance ratio at $t=1$ Gyr by $\sim0.05$ dex and at $t=3$ Gyr by $\sim0.1$ dex, but the equilibrium abundance reached at $t=10$ Gyr remains unchanged.

    \label{fig:onezone-threepanel}
    \script{onezone_threepanel.py}
\end{figure*}

The left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel} shows that the minimum SN Ia delay time has a much stronger effect on the abundance track and MDFs of models which assume a power-law DTD than models which assume a plateau or exponential DTD, due to the much higher SN Ia rate in the power-law models at early times (see Figure \ref{fig:dtds}). Moreover, a power-law DTD with a long minimum delay may be observationally hard to distinguish from a plateau model. In Figure \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel}, the abundance track for the model with a power-law DTD and $t_D=150$ Myr (red dashed line) is similar to that of the plateau DTD with $W=0.3$ Gyr and $t_D=40$ Myr (blue solid line), and the [O/Fe] distributions are virtually identical. 

A 150 Myr minimum delay time is incompatible with the two-population DTD model, which has $\sim 50$\% of SNe Ia explode in the first 100 Myr, and would have a negligible effect on the triple-system DTD as its relative SN Ia rate is so low at early times. 

The right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-twopanel} compares the one-zone model outputs from the full range of DTDs we investigate in this paper. In general, the choice of DTD has the greatest effect on the location of the knee in [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space (center panel) and the high-$\alpha$ end of the distribution of [O/Fe] (right panel). The DTD also has a smaller effect on the MDF in the range $-1.5\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-0.5$ (top panel).

% \subsection{The Star Formation History}

% Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar} shows results from one-zone models with a power-law DTD which differ in their assumed minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$) or star formation efficiency timescale ($\tau_*$). In [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space, doubling or halving the minimum delay time produces similar results to doubling or halving the SFE timescale. A shorter minimum delay time means SNe Ia will start to explode sooner after the star formation burst, giving less time for CCSNe to explode at the plateau of the abundance track. Similarly, a longer SFE timescale means fewer massive stars will be produced by the initial star formation burst, resulting in fewer CCSNe before the first SNe Ia explode. 

% The minimum delay and SFE timescale have similar effects on the abundance tracks but very different effects on the MDFs. Altering the SFE timescale changes the stellar distribution of [Fe/H], especially at the low-metallicity end, as shown in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. However, as a change in the SFE timescale affects both the number of high-mass and low-mass stars produced, it does not affect the distribution of [O/Fe], as shown in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. Meanwhile, a change in the minimum SN Ia delay time does not impact the total number of SNe which explode, so the distribution of [Fe/H] is largely unaffected, while it does result in a change in the number of high-$\alpha$ stars formed and therefore the distribution of [O/Fe].

\subsection{The distribution of [Fe/H]}

To quantify the similarity between the MDFs generated by VICE and the observed APOGEE MDF, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence \citep{KullbackLeibler1951}, defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kl-divergence}
D_{\rm{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\Big(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\Big) dx
\end{equation}
for distributions $P$ and $Q$ with probability density functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. In this case, $P$ is the APOGEE MDF, $Q$ is the model MDF, and $x$ is [Fe/H]. For each model SFH and DTD, we compute $D_{\rm{KL}}$ in 18 different galactocentric zones defined by radial bins $3-5$ kpc, $5-7$ kpc, $7-9$ kpc, $9-11$ kpc, $11-13$ kpc, and $13-15$ kpc and absolute $z$-height bins $0-0.5$ kpc, $0.5-1$ kpc, and $1-2$ kpc. The KL divergence for the entire model is taken to be the average of $D_{\rm{KL}}$ for each zone, weighted by the number of APOGEE stars in each zone.

Holding the SFH fixed, varying the DTD has only a minor effect on the MDF across the disk. Figure \ref{fig:feh-df-dtd} plots the [Fe/H] distributions for two multi-zone simulations which both assume an inside-out SFH but different DTDs: a power-law with slope $\alpha=-1.4$, and an exponential with timescale $\tau=3$ Gyr. The balance between prompt and delayed SNe Ia is starkly different between the two models, with $\sim 80\%$ of SNe Ia exploding within 1 Gyr in the former model but only $\sim 30\%$ in the latter. Nevertheless, the effect of the DTD on the MDF is second-order compared to the effect of the SFH as seen in Figure \ref{fig:feh-df-sfh}.

\subsection{Radial Migration \& Bimodality}

Something about \citet{Johnson2021-Migration} and \citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Our diagnostics consistently favor a DTD with a large fraction of delayed SNe Ia, such as the 3 Gyr exponential, 1 Gyr plateau, or triple system evolution models, over a DTD with a high number of prompt SNe Ia, such as the $t^{-1.4}$ power-law or two-population models. [Discuss the disconnect and/or complement with \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD}, etc.; something about different timescales probed by volumetric surveys vs. us]
    
    \item While the choice of DTD cannot produce a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe], it can affect the shape of the distribution, the ratio of high-$\alpha$ to low-$\alpha$ stars, and the location of the high-$\alpha$ sequence if it exists. The SFH is the critical determining factor in bimodality.

    \item The distribution of [Fe/H] depends strongly on the chosen SFH, but there is only a weak effect from the DTD.

    \item The early-burst SFH model is the only one which produced a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe] across the disk resembling APOGEE, from the models we investigate. [Add: summary of why everything else fails.]

    \item Something about how radial migration can't produce bimodality on its own.

\section{Analytical DTDs}
\label{app:analytical-dtds}

Discuss \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} vs our simple function approximations here?

\citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} derives analytical DTDs for SD and DD progenitor systems from assumptions about binary stellar evolution and outcomes of mass exchange. They find that the parameters which have a large effect on the shape of the DTD are the distribution and range of stellar masses in progenitor systems; the efficiency of accretion in the SD scenario; and the distribution of separations at birth in the DD scenario. Figure \ref{fig:dtd-greggio05} shows the analytical DTDs for SD progenitors and two different prescriptions for DD progenitors (``WIDE'' and ``CLOSE''). In the ``WIDE'' scheme, it is assumed that there is a wide distribution of ratios $A/A_0$ of the separation of the DD system to the initial separation of the binary, and that the distributions of $A$ and total mass of the system $m_{\rm DD}$ are independent, so one cannot necessarily predict the total merge time of a system based on its initial parameters. In the ``CLOSE'' scheme, there is assumed to be a narrow distribution of $A/A_0$ and a correlation between $A$ and $m_{\rm DD}$, so the most massive binaries tend to merge quickly and the least massive merge last.

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-greggio05} shows the results of one-zone chemical evolution models with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} DTDs. We assume $\eta=2.5$, $\tau_*=2$ Gyr, an inside-out SFH evaluated at a radius of 8 kpc, a continuous recycling approximation, and a minimum SN Ia delay of 40 Myr. We compare the SD, DD WIDE, and DD CLOSE schemes to standard power-law, broken power-law, and exponential DTDs. The SD and DD CLOSE DTDs follow nearly identical tracks in [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H]; however, their distributions on [O/Fe] differ at the low end. The SD DTD follows an exponential with a 1.5 Gyr timescale, whereas the DD CLOSE DTD is well-approximated by a broken power-law with an initial plateau of 350 Myr and a subsequent declining slope of -1.1. The WIDE prescription is likewise best approximated by a broken power-law, but with a longer plateau width of 1 Gyr. In all cases, the difference between the analytical DTD and the nearest broken power-law or exponential is likely too small to be observationally detectable, so in our multi-zone models we implement the more generic functions in lieu of the analytical DTDs.

A multi-zone with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} SD DTD produced nearly identical results to an exponential DTD with a 1.5 Gyr timescale.

\section{Stellar Migration}
\label{app:migration}

For each star particle in VICE, \citet{Johnson2021-Migration} randomly assign an analogue star particle from \texttt{h277} and adopt its radial migration distance $\Delta R$ and final midplane distance $z$. This allows VICE to adopt a realistic pattern of radial migration without needing to implement its own hydrodynamical simulation. However, in regions where the number of h277 star particles is relatively low, such as at large $R_{\rm gal}$ and small $t$, a single h277 star particle can be assigned as an analogue to multiple VICE stellar populations. These populations will have similar formation and migration histories and consequently similar abundances, which produces unphysical ``clumps'' of stars in the abundance distributions at high latitudes and large radii. 

We fit a Gaussian to the distribution of $\Delta R = R_{\rm final} - R_{\rm initial}$ from the \texttt{h277} output in bins of $R_{\rm initial}$ and age. Each Gaussian is centered at 0 and we find that the scale $\sigma_{\Delta R}$ is best described by the function
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\Delta R} = 1.35\,{\rm kpc} \Big(\frac{R_{\rm form}}{8\,{\rm kpc}}\Big)^{0.61} \Big(\frac{\tau}{1\,{\rm Gyr}}\Big)^{0.33}
    \label{eq:radial-migration}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the age of the star particle. 

We fit a sech$^2$ function \citep{Spitzer1942} to the distribution of midplane distances $z_{\rm final}$. Vertical migration away from the midplane does not affect the chemical evolution simulation, but we do use $z_{\rm final}$ in our analysis. The probability density function (PDF) of $z_{\rm final}$ given some scale height $h_z$ is
\begin{equation}
    {\rm PDF}(z_{\rm final}) = \frac{1}{4 h_z} {\rm sech}^2\Big(\frac{z_{\rm final}}{2 h_z}\Big)
    \label{eq:sech-pdf}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) is
\begin{equation}
    {\rm CDF}(z_{\rm final}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z_{\rm final} / h_z}}.
    \label{eq:sech-cdf}
\end{equation}
We fit the above function to the distributions of $z_{\rm final}$ in h277 in varying bins of $\tau$ and $R_{\rm final}$ and found that $h_z$ is best described by the function
\begin{equation}
    h_z = (0.25\,{\rm kpc}) 
    e^{\frac{\tau-5\,{\rm Gyr}}{7.0\,{\rm Gyr}}}
    e^{\frac{R_{\rm final}-8\,{\rm kpc}}{6.0\,{\rm kpc}}}.
    \label{eq:scale-height}
\end{equation}

When a star particle is created by VICE at initial radius $R_{\rm form}$, we sample its total radial migration distance $\Delta R$ from a Gaussian with a width described by Equation \ref{eq:radial-migration}, and we sample its final midplane distance $z_{\rm final}$ from the distribution described by Equation \ref{eq:sech-pdf} with a width given by Equation \ref{eq:scale-height}. The star particle migrates to its final radius $R_{\rm final}$ in a similar manner to the ``diffusion'' case from \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}, but with a time dependence $\propto t^{1/3}$. This produces distributions of $R_{\rm final}$ and $z_{\rm final}$ which are similar to the analogue migration case for all but the oldest stars. 

Figure \ref{fig:radial-migration} compares the distributions of $R_{\rm final}$ in bins of $R_{\rm form}$ and age between the analogue and Gaussian migration schema. The
