\subsection{Accuracy of astroNN}
\label{sec:astronn-quality}

For $19784$ stars, or $\sim3.5\%$ of the sample, the astroNN [Fe/H] abundance estimate is $\gtrsim0.5$ dex lower than the value provided by ASPCAP. The vast majority of these stars are on the lower-main sequence according to \textit{Gaia} photometry, so we exclude stars with $\log(g) > 4$ in ASPCAP. In addition, 197 or $\sim3\%$ of stars with APOKASC-2 asteroseismic ages are reported to be $>5$ Gyr younger by astroNN. The APOKASC-2 age is unphysically high for many of these stars, often exceeding 15 Gyr. We identify prior mass loss as the cause of this discrepancy, so the astroNN ages are likely closer to the truth.

\end{figure}

\citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing} take their DTD to be an exponential with a 1.5 Gyr timescale, though this isn't strictly observationally motivated.

\citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} compare volumetric SN Ia rates to the cosmic star formation history. They get a power law with a slope of $-1.13\pm 0.06$ for field galaxies, and a slope of $-1.39^{+0.32}_{-0.05}$ for galaxy clusters.

\citet{Heringer2019-FieldGalaxyDTD} study the distribution of SNe Ia in field galaxies and get a power-law index of $-1.34^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$ which is closer to Maoz's cluster DTD.

\citet{Stolger2020-ExponentialDTD} perform maximum likelihood estimations based on the cosmic star formation history and the star formation histories of individual galaxies. In both cases their best fit functions were approximately exponential, though they started with a skew-normal function so could not have ended up with a power law even if they wanted to. They don't actually report the timescale of this exponential, but based on the plots I'd say it's about 1.5 - 2 (1.7?) Gyr. Their best fit parameters make no sense to me as they don't report their units.

\citet{Wiseman2021-DESRates} measure the SN Ia rate in the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.6$ and get a similar power law to \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} with a slope of $-1.13 \pm 0.05$. They also find that slower-declining SNe have a steeper DTD slope.

\subsection{One-Zone Models}
\label{sec:onezone-results}

All models are run for a duration of 13.2 Gyr with a simulation timestep of 0.01 Gyr.

\subsubsection{The SN Ia Delay-Time Distribution}

Adjusting the parameters of the DTD affects how steeply the abundance track in [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space falls from its initial ``plateau'' and the location of the ``knee.'' Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} shows abundance tracks from one-zone models which assume different slopes of a power-law DTD or different timescales of an exponential DTD. A steeper power-law slope results in a steeper decline in [O/Fe] and a lower knee, as does a shorter exponential timescale. The consequence is that a very shallow power-law produces a similar abundance track to a very steep exponential, which suggests these models may be difficult to distinguish in this parameter space. However, these cases can be distinguished by their MDFs and [O/Fe] distributions, where the power-law DTD produces a narrower, less skewed distribution while the exponential DTD produces a broader, more skewed distribution. In the [O/Fe] distribution especially, an exponential DTD with a 6 Gyr timescale produces a large number of high-$\alpha$ stars.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_slope_timescale.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Center:} Abundance tracks in the [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] plane for one-zone models with various DTD parameters. Tracks from models which assume a power-law DTD are in black, with dotted, dashed, and solid curves representing power-law slopes ($\alpha$) of $-0.8$, $-1.1$, and $-1.4$, respectively. Tracks from models which assume an exponential DTD are in blue, with dotted, dashed, and solid curves representing exponential decay timescales ($\tau$) of 1.5 Gyr, 3 Gyr, and 6 Gyr, respectively. In all cases a minimum delay time of 40 Myr is assumed. \textit{Top:} MDFs generated by the one-zone models. \textit{Right:} Distribution of [O/Fe] generated by the one-zone models.}
    \label{fig:onezone-slope-timescale}
    \script{onezone_slope_timescale.py}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-dtd} compares the one-zone model outputs from the full range of DTDs we investigate in this paper. In general, the choice of DTD has the greatest effect on the location of the knee in [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space (center panel) and the high-$\alpha$ end of the distribution of [O/Fe] (right panel). The DTD also has a smaller effect on the MDF in the range $-15.5\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-0.5$ (top panel).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_dtd.pdf}
    \caption{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} but with a different selection of DTDs. In all cases a minimum delay time of 40 Myr is assumed.}
    \label{fig:onezone-dtd}
    \script{onezone_dtd.py}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Minimum SN Ia Delay Time}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-dtd-delay} shows that the minimum SN Ia delay time has a much stronger effect on the abundance track and MDFs of models which assume a power-law DTD than models which assume an exponential, due to the much higher SN Ia rate in the power-law models at early times (see Figure \ref{fig:dtds}). Moreover, a power-law DTD with a long minimum delay may be observationally hard to distinguish from an exponential. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_dtd_delay.pdf}
    \caption{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} but with varying minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$). Dashed curves represent models with a minimum delay time of 40 Myr, while solid curves represent models with a minimum delay time of 150 Myr. The black curves represent a power-law DTD with a slope of $-1.1$, while the blue curves represent an exponential DTD with a timescale of 1.5 Gyr.}
    \label{fig:onezone-dtd-delay}
    \script{onezone_dtd_delay.py}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Star Formation History}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar} shows results from one-zone models with a power-law DTD which differ in their assumed minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$) or star formation efficiency timescale ($\tau_*$). In [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space, doubling or halving the minimum delay time produces similar results to doubling or halving the SFE timescale. A shorter minimum delay time means SNe Ia will start to explode sooner after the star formation burst, giving less time for CCSNe to explode at the plateau of the abundance track. Similarly, a longer SFE timescale means fewer massive stars will be produced by the initial star formation burst, resulting in fewer CCSNe before the first SNe Ia explode. 

The minimum delay and SFE timescale have similar effects on the abundance tracks but very different effects on the MDFs. Altering the SFE timescale changes the stellar distribution of [Fe/H], especially at the low-metallicity end, as shown in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. However, as a change in the SFE timescale affects both the number of high-mass and low-mass stars produced, it does not affect the distribution of [O/Fe], as shown in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. Meanwhile, a change in the minimum SN Ia delay time does not impact the total number of SNe which explode, so the distribution of [Fe/H] is largely unaffected, while it does result in a change in the number of high-$\alpha$ stars formed and therefore the distribution of [O/Fe].

    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_delay_taustar.pdf}
    \caption{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} but with varying minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$) and star formation efficiency timescale ($\tau_*$). Tracks with $\tau_*=2$ Gyr are represented in black, while a track with a shorter $\tau_*=1$ Gyr is shown in red and a track with a longer $\tau_*=4$ Gyr is in yellow. The dotted, solid, and dashed black curves represent a minimum delay time of 40 Myr, 80 Myr, and 160 Myr, respectively. A power-law DTD is assumed in all models.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Analytical Formulations}

\citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} derives analytical DTDs for SD and DD progenitor systems from assumptions about binary stellar evolution and outcomes of mass exchange. They find that the parameters which have a large effect on the shape of the DTD are the distribution and range of stellar masses in progenitor systems; the efficiency of accretion in the SD scenario; and the distribution of separations at birth in the DD scenario. Figure \ref{fig:greggio05-dtd} shows the analytical DTDs for SD progenitors and two different prescriptions for DD progenitors (``WIDE'' and ``CLOSE''). In the ``WIDE'' scheme, it is assumed that there is a wide distribution of ratios $A/A_0$ of the separation of the DD system to the initial separation of the binary, and that the distributions of $A$ and total mass of the system $m_{\rm{DD}}$ are independent, so one cannot necessarily predict the total merge time of a system based on its initial parameters. In the ``CLOSE'' scheme, there is assumed to be a narrow distribution of $A/A_0$ and a correlation between $A$ and $m_{\rm{DD}}$, so the most massive binaries tend to merge quickly and the least massive merge last.

An implementation of these DTDs in a chemical evolution model requires numerical integration (see their Equations 14, 33, and 34, respectively, for the exact functional forms), so to save on computation time we approximate the DTD for the DD prescriptions as a broken power-law with an exponential rise and tail:

\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm{Ia}}^{\rm{DD}}(t) \propto
    \begin{cases}
        t^{\alpha_1} (1 - A_{\rm{rise}} e^{-t/\tau_{\rm{rise}}}) & t \le 1~\rm{Gyr} \\
        B t^{\alpha_2} (1 + A_{\rm{tail}} e^{-(t - 1~\rm{Gyr})/\tau_{\rm{tail}}}) & t > 1~\rm{Gyr}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:greggio05-approx}
\end{equation}

\noindent with the normalization $B$ of the second part set such that

\begin{equation}
    B = \frac{1}{1 + A_{\rm{tail}}} t^{(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)} (1 - A_{\rm{rise}} e^{-(1~\rm{Gyr})/\tau_{\rm{rise}}}).
\end{equation}

\noindent We use a non-linear least squares method to fit Equation \ref{eq:greggio05-approx} to the analytical DTDs for DD progenitors. We obtain best-fit parameters $\alpha_1=-0.19$, $A_{\rm{rise}}=1.7$, $\tau_{\rm{rise}}=0.084$ Gyr, $\alpha_2=-0.91$, $A_{\rm{tail}}=0.85$, and $\tau_{\rm{tail}}=0.088$ Gyr for the ``WIDE'' scheme, and $\alpha_1=-0.53$, $A_{\rm{rise}}=3.0$, $\tau_{\rm{rise}}=0.042$ Gyr, $\alpha_2=-1.1$, $A_{\rm{tail}}=0.62$, and $\tau_{\rm{tail}}=0.11$ Gyr for the ``CLOSE'' scheme.\footnote{
Our implementation of these best-fit approximations, as well as the original SD and DD formulations, is available in the GitHub repository for this paper.
} These best-fit approximations are represented by the dashed curves in Figure \ref{fig:greggio05-dtd} \citep[see also Figure 8 in][]{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}. The difference between the true analytical DTDs and our best-fit approximations is small enough as to be irrelevant for our purposes, so for the rest of this section we rely on the best-fit approximations for faster simulations.

The solid red curve represents the SD DTD for Chandrasekhar explosions, while the green and blue solid curves represent, respectively, the CLOSE and WIDE formulations of a DD DTD. The best-fit approximations for the DD DTDs (see Equation \ref{eq:greggio05-approx}) are represented by the dashed olive and cyan curves, respectively. All DTDs are normalized to unity.}

    \script{greggio05_dtd.py}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-greggio05} shows the results of one-zone chemical evolution models with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} DTDs. We assume $\eta=2.5$, $\tau_*=2$ Gyr, an inside-out SFH evaluated at a radius of 8 kpc, a continuous recycling approximation, and a minimum SN Ia delay of 40 Myr. We compare the SD, DD WIDE, and DD CLOSE schemes to standard power-law, broken power-law, and exponential DTDs. The SD and DD CLOSE DTDs follow nearly identical tracks in [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H]; however, their distributions on [O/Fe] differ at the low end. The SD DTD follows an exponential with a 1.5 Gyr timescale, whereas the DD CLOSE DTD is well-approximated by a broken power-law with an initial plateau of 350 Myr and a subsequent declining slope of -1.1. The WIDE prescription is likewise best approximated by a broken power-law, but with a longer plateau width of 1 Gyr. In all cases, the difference between the analytical DTD and the nearest broken power-law or exponential is likely too small to be observationally detectable, so in our multi-zone models we implement the more generic functions in lieu of the analytical DTDs.

A multi-zone with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} SD DTD produced nearly identical results to an exponential DTD with a 1.5 Gyr timescale.
