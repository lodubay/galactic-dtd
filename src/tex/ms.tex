\begin{abstract}
    Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) produce most of Fe-peak elements in the Universe and therefore are a crucial ingredient in galactic chemical evolution models. SNe Ia do not explode immediately after star formation and the delay-time distribution (DTD) has not been definitively determined by supernova surveys or theoretical models. Because the DTD also affects the relationship among age, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] in chemical evolution models, comparison with observations of stars in the Milky Way is an important consistency check for any proposed DTD. We implement several popular forms of the DTD in combination with multiple star formation histories for the Milky Way in one-zone and multi-zone chemical evolution models using the Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE). VICE includes a prescription for radial stellar migration in multi-zone models. We compare our predicted interstellar medium abundance tracks, stellar abundance distributions, and stellar age distributions to the 17th data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We find that the SN Ia DTD has the largest effect on the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution: a DTD with more prompt SNe Ia produces a stellar abundance distribution that is skewed toward a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio, whereas a DTD with more delayed SNe Ia produces a distribution that is skewed toward higher [$\alpha$/Fe]. While the DTD alone cannot explain the observed bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution, in combination with an appropriate star formation history it affects the goodness of fit between the simulated and observed high-$\alpha$ sequence.

\subsection{DTD Models}
\label{sec:dtd-models}

We explore five different functional forms for the SN Ia DTD: a power-law, a broken power-law with an initial flat plateau, an exponential, an exponential with a prompt Gaussian component, with one or two different parameterizations for each. Figure \ref{fig:dtds} presents these DTDs as a function of time since star formation.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/delay_time_distributions.pdf}

    \label{fig:dtds}
    \script{delay_time_distributions.py}
\end{figure}

% \citet{Stolger2020-ExponentialDTD} perform maximum likelihood estimations based on the cosmic star formation history and the star formation histories of individual galaxies. In both cases their best fit functions were approximately exponential, though they started with a skew-normal function so could not have ended up with a power law even if they wanted to. They don't actually report the timescale of this exponential, but based on the plots I'd say it's about 1.5 - 2 (1.7?) Gyr. Their best fit parameters make no sense to me as they don't report their units.

\paragraph{Power-law} A simple power law with slope $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = A_\alpha (t/1\,\rm{Gyr})^\alpha
    \label{eq:powerlaw-dtd}
\end{equation}
where $A_\alpha = (\alpha+1)(t_{\rm max}^{\alpha+1} - t_{\rm min}^{\alpha+1})^{-1}$ is the normalization coefficient.
We investigate the cases $\alpha=-1.1$ and $\alpha=-1.4$, which correspond to the field galaxy and galaxy cluster DTDs of \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD}, respectively.

A typical form for the DTD is a power-law $t^\alpha$ where $\alpha\sim-1$. \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} compare volumetric SN Ia rates to the cosmic star formation history. They get a power law with a slope of $-1.13\pm 0.06$ for field galaxies, and a slope of $-1.39^{+0.32}_{-0.05}$ for galaxy clusters.

\citet{Heringer2019-FieldGalaxyDTD} study the distribution of SNe Ia in field galaxies and get a power-law index of $-1.34^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$ which is closer to Maoz's cluster DTD.

\citet{Wiseman2021-DESRates} measure the SN Ia rate in the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.6$ and get a similar power law to \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD} with a slope of $-1.13 \pm 0.05$. They also find that slower-declining SNe have a steeper DTD slope.

\paragraph{Plateau} A ``plateau'' model consisting of a flat slope of width $W$ followed by a power law decline with normalization $B_W$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        B_W, & t < W \\
        B_W (t/W)^\alpha, & t \ge W
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:plateau-dtd}
\end{equation}
where $B_W=[(W-t_{\rm min}) + \frac{t_{\rm max}^{\alpha+1} - W^{\alpha+1}}{(\alpha+1)W^\alpha}]^{-1}$ is the normalization coefficient.
We investigate the cases $W=0.3$ Gyr and $W=1$ Gyr, taking $\alpha=-1.1$ for all plateau models. Figure \ref{fig:dtd-greggio05} illustrates the similarity between these models and two different treatments of the analytical double-degenerate DTD from \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/dtd_greggio05.pdf}
    \caption{Analytical DTDs from \citet[][solid curves]{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} and close approximation simple functions (dashed curves). Some functions are presented with a constant multiplicative factor for visual clarity.}
    \label{fig:dtd-greggio05}
    \script{dtd_greggio05.py}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Exponential} An exponentially declining DTD with timescale $\tau$ and normalization $C_\tau$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = \frac{1}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau}
    \label{eq:exponential-dtd}
\end{equation}
We investigate the case where $\tau=1.5$ Gyr, which has been used in previous studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing,Weinberg2017-ChemicalEquilibrium} and is similar to the analytical single-degenerate DTD from \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates}. We also investigate a longer timescale of $\tau=3$ Gyr. \citet{Matteucci1986-SupernovaEnrichment}, \citet{Stolger2020-ExponentialDTD}

\paragraph{Prompt} A DTD in which 50\% of SNe Ia belong to a ``prompt'' Gaussian component at small $t$ and the other 50\% form an exponential tail at large $t$, normalized by $D_{t_p,\sigma,\tau}$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = D_{t_p,\sigma,\tau} \Big[e^{-\frac{(t-t_p)^2}{2\sigma^2}} + e^{-t/\tau}\Big]
    \label{eq:prompt-dtd}
\end{equation}
Following the two-population model from \citet{Mannucci2006-TwoPopulations}, we take $t_p=50$ Myr, $\sigma=15$ Myr, and $\tau=3$ Gyr, which results in roughly 50\% of SNe Ia exploding within $t<100$ Myr.

\paragraph{Triple} A DTD based on simulations of triple-system evolution by \citet{Rajamuthukumar2022-TripleEvolution}. We approximate their DTD as a special case of the plateau model (Equation \ref{eq:plateau-dtd}) where the initial rate is quite low until an instantaneous rise to the plateau value at time $t_{\rm rise}$:
\begin{equation}
    R(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \epsilon B_W, & t < t_{\rm rise} \\
        B_W, & t_{\rm rise} \leq t < W \\
        B_W (t / W) ^ \alpha, & t \geq W
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:triple-dtd}
\end{equation}
We take $t_{\rm rise}=0.5$ Gyr, $W=0.5$ Gyr, $\alpha=-1.1$, and $\epsilon=0.05$ so the initial rate is 5\% of the peak rate.

\subsection{Star Formation Histories}
\label{sec:sfh}

Figure \ref{fig:sfhs} presents an overview of our model star formation histories.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/star_formation_histories.pdf}
    \caption{The surface densities of star formation $\dot \Sigma_*$ (first row), gas infall $\dot \Sigma_{\rm in}$ (second row), and gas mass $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ (third row), and the star formation efficiency timescale $\tau_*$ (fourth row) as functions of simulation time for our four model SFHs: inside-out (first column; see Equation \ref{eq:insideout-sfh}), late-burst (second column; see Equation \ref{eq:lateburst-sfh}), early-burst (third column; see Equations \ref{eq:earlyburst-ifr} and \ref{eq:earlyburst-taustar}), and two-infall (fourth column; see Equation \ref{eq:twoinfall-ifr}). In each panel, we plot curves for the zones which have inner radii of 4 kpc (yellow), 6 kpc (orange), 8 kpc (red), 10 kpc (violet), 12 kpc (indigo), and 14 kpc (blue).}
    \label{fig:sfhs}
    \script{star_formation_histories.py}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Inside-out}
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm IO}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = (1 - e^{-t/\tau_{\rm rise}}) e^{-t/\tau_{\rm SFH}}
    \label{eq:insideout-sfh}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Late-burst}
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm LB}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = f_{\rm IO}(t|R_{\rm gal}) \Big(1 + A_b e^{-(t-t_b)^2/2\sigma_b^2} \Big)
    \label{eq:lateburst-sfh}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Early-burst} The infall rate at a given radius declines exponentially with time:
\begin{equation}
    f_{\rm EB}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = e^{-t/\tau_{\rm IFR}}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-ifr}
\end{equation}
We take $\tau_{\rm IFR} = \tau_{\rm SFH}$ at all radii.
The time-dependence of the SFE timescale $\tau_*$ comes from \citet{Conroy2022-ThickDisk}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\tau_*(t|\Sigma_g)}{1\,\rm{Gyr}} =
    \begin{cases}
        50, & t < 2.5\,\rm{Gyr} \\
        \frac{50}{[1+3(t-2.5)]^2}, & 2.5\leq t \leq 3.7\,\rm{Gyr} \\
        2.36, & t > 3.7\,\rm{Gyr}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-conroy22}
\end{equation}
We combine this with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation used by \citet{Johnson2021-Migration}, minus the dependence on the molecular timescale $\tau_{\rm mol}$:
\begin{equation}
    \dot \Sigma_* = 
    \begin{cases}
        \Sigma_g, & \Sigma_g \geq \Sigma_{g,2} \\
        \Sigma_g \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,2}}\Big)^{2.6}, & \Sigma_{g,1} \leq \Sigma_g \leq \Sigma_{g,2} \\
        \Sigma_g \Big(\frac{\Sigma_{g,1}}{\Sigma_{g,2}}\Big)^{2.6} \Big(\frac{\Sigma_g}{\Sigma_{g,1}}\Big)^{0.7}, & \Sigma_g \leq \Sigma_{g,1}
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:kennicutt-schmidt}
\end{equation}
Which leads to an overall SFE timescale of
\begin{equation}
    \tau_*(t,\Sigma_g) = \tau_*(t|\Sigma_g) \frac{\Sigma_g}{\dot \Sigma_*}
    \label{eq:earlyburst-taustar}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Two-infall} 
We parameterize the infall rate as two successive, exponentially declining bursts as in \citet{Chiappini2001-AbundanceGradients}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:twoinfall-ifr}
    f_{\rm TI}(t|R_{\rm gal}) = N_1(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-t/\tau_1} + N_2(R_{\rm gal}) e^{-(t-t_{\rm on})/\tau_2}
\end{equation}
In this model, the first infall produces the thick disk and the second infall produces the thin disk. The normalization ratio $N_2/N_1$ is calculated so that the thick-to-thin-disk surface density ratio $f_\Sigma(R)=\Sigma_2(R)/\Sigma_1(R)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    f_\Sigma(R) = f_\Sigma(0) e^{R(1/R_2 - 1/R_1)}
\end{equation}
where we take the thick disk scale radius $R_1=2.0$ kpc, thin disk scale radius $R_2=2.5$ kpc, and $f_\Sigma(0)=0.27$ following \citet{BlandHawthornGerhard2016-MilkyWayReview}.

\subsection{Stellar Migration}
\label{sec:migration}

For each star particle in VICE, \citet{Johnson2021-Migration} randomly assign an analogue star particle from \texttt{h277} and adopt its radial migration distance $\Delta R$ and final midplane distance $z$. This allows VICE to adopt a realistic pattern of radial migration without needing to implement its own hydrodynamical simulation. However, in regions where the number of h277 star particles is relatively low, such as at large $R_{\rm gal}$ and small $t$, a single h277 star particle can be assigned as an analogue to multiple VICE stellar populations. These populations will have similar formation and migration histories and consequently similar abundances, which produces unphysical ``clumps'' of stars in the abundance distributions at high latitudes and large radii. 

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/radial_migration.pdf}
    \caption{The distribution of final radius $R_{\rm final}$ as a function of formation radius and age for the h277 analogue (top row) and Gaussian sampling scheme (bottom row). From left to right, star particles are binned by formation annulus, from the inner disk (far left column) to the Solar annulus (center column) to the outer disk (far right column). Within each panel, colored curves represent the different age bins, ranging from the youngest stars (dark blue) to the oldest (dark red). The vertical dotted black lines indicate the bounds of each bin in formation radius; stars within that region of the distribution have not migrated outside their birth annulus over their lifetime.}
    \label{fig:radial-migration}
    \script{radial_migration.py}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/midplane_distance.pdf}
    \caption{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:radial-migration} but for the distribution of final midplane distance $z_{\rm final}$ as a function of final radius and age. From left to right, star particles are binned by \textit{final} annulus.}
    \label{fig:midplane-distance}
    \script{midplane_distance.py}
\end{figure*}

We fit a Gaussian to the distribution of $\Delta R = R_{\rm final} - R_{\rm initial}$ from the \texttt{h277} output in bins of $R_{\rm initial}$ and age. Each Gaussian is centered at 0 and we find that the scale $\sigma_{\Delta R}$ is best described by the function

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\Delta R} = 1.35\,{\rm kpc} \Big(\frac{R_{\rm form}}{8\,{\rm kpc}}\Big)^{0.61} \Big(\frac{\tau}{1\,{\rm Gyr}}\Big)^{0.33}
    \label{eq:radial-migration}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\tau$ is the age of the star particle. 

We fit a sech$^2$ function \citep{Spitzer1942} to the distribution of midplane distances $z_{\rm final}$. Vertical migration away from the midplane does not affect the chemical evolution simulation, but we do use $z_{\rm final}$ in our analysis. The probability density function (PDF) of $z_{\rm final}$ given some scale height $h_z$ is

\begin{equation}
    {\rm PDF}(z_{\rm final}) = \frac{1}{4 h_z} {\rm sech}^2\Big(\frac{z_{\rm final}}{2 h_z}\Big)
    \label{eq:sech-pdf}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) is

\begin{equation}
    {\rm CDF}(z_{\rm final}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z_{\rm final} / h_z}}.
    \label{eq:sech-cdf}
\end{equation}

\noindent We fit the above function to the distributions of $z_{\rm final}$ in h277 in varying bins of $\tau$ and $R_{\rm final}$ and found that $h_z$ is best described by the function

\begin{equation}
    h_z = (0.25\,{\rm kpc}) 
    e^{\frac{\tau-5\,{\rm Gyr}}{7.0\,{\rm Gyr}}}
    e^{\frac{R_{\rm final}-8\,{\rm kpc}}{6.0\,{\rm kpc}}}
    \label{eq:scale-height}
\end{equation}

\subsection{APOGEE Data}
\label{sec:apogee-data}

We use APOGEE DR17 \citep{Abdurro'uf2022-SDSSIV-DR17}. Our selection criteria are presented in Table \ref{tab:sample-selection}, producing a final sample of \variable{output/sample_size.txt} stars. We limit to stars with a reported measurement of both [Fe/H] and [O/Fe].

\subsubsection{Stellar Ages}
\label{sec:stellar-ages}

191,179 stars in our sample have astroNN ages and 71,684 have ages from \citet{Leung2023-Ages}.

% For $19784$ stars, or $\sim3.5\%$ of the sample, the astroNN [Fe/H] abundance estimate is $\gtrsim0.5$ dex lower than the value provided by ASPCAP. The vast majority of these stars are on the lower-main sequence according to \textit{Gaia} photometry, so we exclude stars with $\log(g) > 4$ in ASPCAP. In addition, 197 or $\sim3\%$ of stars with APOKASC-2 asteroseismic ages are reported to be $>5$ Gyr younger by astroNN. The APOKASC-2 age is unphysically high for many of these stars, often exceeding 15 Gyr. We identify prior mass loss as the cause of this discrepancy, so the astroNN ages are likely closer to the truth.

\section{Results from Single-Zone Models}
\label{sec:onezone-results}

All models are run for a duration of 13.2 Gyr with a simulation timestep of 0.01 Gyr.

\subsection{The SN Ia Delay-Time Distribution}

Adjusting the parameters of the DTD affects how steeply the abundance track in [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space falls from its initial ``plateau'' and the location of the ``knee.'' Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} shows abundance tracks from one-zone models which assume different slopes of a power-law DTD or different timescales of an exponential DTD. A steeper power-law slope results in a steeper decline in [O/Fe] and a lower knee, as does a shorter exponential timescale. The consequence is that a very shallow power-law produces a similar abundance track to a very steep exponential, which suggests these models may be difficult to distinguish in this parameter space. However, these cases can be distinguished by their MDFs and [O/Fe] distributions, where the power-law DTD produces a narrower, less skewed distribution while the exponential DTD produces a broader, more skewed distribution. In the [O/Fe] distribution especially, an exponential DTD with a 6 Gyr timescale produces a large number of high-$\alpha$ stars.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_slope_timescale.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Center:} Abundance tracks in the [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] plane for one-zone models with various DTD parameters. Tracks from models which assume a power-law DTD are in black, with dotted, dashed, and solid curves representing power-law slopes ($\alpha$) of $-0.8$, $-1.1$, and $-1.4$, respectively. Tracks from models which assume an exponential DTD are in blue, with dotted, dashed, and solid curves representing exponential decay timescales ($\tau$) of 1.5 Gyr, 3 Gyr, and 6 Gyr, respectively. In all cases a minimum delay time of 40 Myr is assumed. \textit{Top:} MDFs generated by the one-zone models. \textit{Right:} Distribution of [O/Fe] generated by the one-zone models.}
    \label{fig:onezone-slope-timescale}
    \script{onezone_slope_timescale.py}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-dtd} compares the one-zone model outputs from the full range of DTDs we investigate in this paper. In general, the choice of DTD has the greatest effect on the location of the knee in [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space (center panel) and the high-$\alpha$ end of the distribution of [O/Fe] (right panel). The DTD also has a smaller effect on the MDF in the range $-15.5\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-0.5$ (top panel).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_dtd.pdf}
    \caption{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} but with a different selection of DTDs. In all cases a minimum delay time of 40 Myr is assumed.}
    \label{fig:onezone-dtd}
    \script{onezone_dtd.py}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Minimum SN Ia Delay Time}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-dtd-delay} shows that the minimum SN Ia delay time has a much stronger effect on the abundance track and MDFs of models which assume a power-law DTD than models which assume an exponential, due to the much higher SN Ia rate in the power-law models at early times (see Figure \ref{fig:dtds}). Moreover, a power-law DTD with a long minimum delay may be observationally hard to distinguish from an exponential. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/onezone_dtd_delay.pdf}
    \caption{Similar to Figure \ref{fig:onezone-slope-timescale} but with varying minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$). Dashed curves represent models with a minimum delay time of 40 Myr, while solid curves represent models with a minimum delay time of 150 Myr. The black curves represent a power-law DTD with a slope of $-1.1$, while the blue curves represent an exponential DTD with a timescale of 1.5 Gyr.}
    \label{fig:onezone-dtd-delay}
    \script{onezone_dtd_delay.py}
\end{figure}

A 150 Myr minimum delay time is incompatible with the prompt DTD model, which has $\sim 50$ of SNe Ia explode in the first 100 Myr.

\subsection{The Star Formation History}

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar} shows results from one-zone models with a power-law DTD which differ in their assumed minimum SN Ia delay time ($t_D$) or star formation efficiency timescale ($\tau_*$). In [Fe/H]-[O/Fe] space, doubling or halving the minimum delay time produces similar results to doubling or halving the SFE timescale. A shorter minimum delay time means SNe Ia will start to explode sooner after the star formation burst, giving less time for CCSNe to explode at the plateau of the abundance track. Similarly, a longer SFE timescale means fewer massive stars will be produced by the initial star formation burst, resulting in fewer CCSNe before the first SNe Ia explode. 

The minimum delay and SFE timescale have similar effects on the abundance tracks but very different effects on the MDFs. Altering the SFE timescale changes the stellar distribution of [Fe/H], especially at the low-metallicity end, as shown in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. However, as a change in the SFE timescale affects both the number of high-mass and low-mass stars produced, it does not affect the distribution of [O/Fe], as shown in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:onezone-delay-taustar}. Meanwhile, a change in the minimum SN Ia delay time does not impact the total number of SNe which explode, so the distribution of [Fe/H] is largely unaffected, while it does result in a change in the number of high-$\alpha$ stars formed and therefore the distribution of [O/Fe].

\subsection{Analytical Formulations}

\citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} derives analytical DTDs for SD and DD progenitor systems from assumptions about binary stellar evolution and outcomes of mass exchange. They find that the parameters which have a large effect on the shape of the DTD are the distribution and range of stellar masses in progenitor systems; the efficiency of accretion in the SD scenario; and the distribution of separations at birth in the DD scenario. Figure \ref{fig:dtd-greggio05} shows the analytical DTDs for SD progenitors and two different prescriptions for DD progenitors (``WIDE'' and ``CLOSE''). In the ``WIDE'' scheme, it is assumed that there is a wide distribution of ratios $A/A_0$ of the separation of the DD system to the initial separation of the binary, and that the distributions of $A$ and total mass of the system $m_{\rm DD}$ are independent, so one cannot necessarily predict the total merge time of a system based on its initial parameters. In the ``CLOSE'' scheme, there is assumed to be a narrow distribution of $A/A_0$ and a correlation between $A$ and $m_{\rm DD}$, so the most massive binaries tend to merge quickly and the least massive merge last.

Figure \ref{fig:onezone-greggio05} shows the results of one-zone chemical evolution models with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} DTDs. We assume $\eta=2.5$, $\tau_*=2$ Gyr, an inside-out SFH evaluated at a radius of 8 kpc, a continuous recycling approximation, and a minimum SN Ia delay of 40 Myr. We compare the SD, DD WIDE, and DD CLOSE schemes to standard power-law, broken power-law, and exponential DTDs. The SD and DD CLOSE DTDs follow nearly identical tracks in [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H]; however, their distributions on [O/Fe] differ at the low end. The SD DTD follows an exponential with a 1.5 Gyr timescale, whereas the DD CLOSE DTD is well-approximated by a broken power-law with an initial plateau of 350 Myr and a subsequent declining slope of -1.1. The WIDE prescription is likewise best approximated by a broken power-law, but with a longer plateau width of 1 Gyr. In all cases, the difference between the analytical DTD and the nearest broken power-law or exponential is likely too small to be observationally detectable, so in our multi-zone models we implement the more generic functions in lieu of the analytical DTDs.

A multi-zone with the \citet{Greggio2005-AnalyticalRates} SD DTD produced nearly identical results to an exponential DTD with a 1.5 Gyr timescale.

\subsection{Comparison to APOGEE MDFs}

To quantify the similarity between the MDFs generated by VICE and the observed APOGEE MDF, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence \citep{KullbackLeibler1951}, defined as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kl-divergence}
D_{\rm{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\Big(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\Big) dx
\end{equation}

\noindent for distributions $P$ and $Q$ with probability density functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. In this case, $P$ is the APOGEE MDF, $Q$ is the model MDF, and $x$ is [Fe/H]. For each model SFH and DTD, we compute $D_{\rm{KL}}$ in 18 different galactocentric zones defined by radial bins $3-5$ kpc, $5-7$ kpc, $7-9$ kpc, $9-11$ kpc, $11-13$ kpc, and $13-15$ kpc and absolute $z$-height bins $0-0.5$ kpc, $0.5-1$ kpc, and $1-2$ kpc. The KL divergence for the entire model is taken to be the average of $D_{\rm{KL}}$ for each zone, weighted by the number of APOGEE stars in each zone.

\subsection{Radial Migration \& Bimodality}

Something about \citet{Johnson2021-Migration} and \citet{Schonrich2009-RadialMixing}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Our diagnostics consistently favor a DTD with a large fraction of delayed SNe Ia, such as the 3 Gyr exponential, 1 Gyr plateau, or triple system evolution models, over a DTD with a high number of prompt SNe Ia, such as the $t^{-1.4}$ power law or prompt models. [Discuss the disconnect and/or complement with \citet{Maoz2017-CosmicDTD}, etc.; something about different timescales probed by volumetric surveys vs. us]
    
    \item While the choice of DTD cannot produce a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe], it can affect the shape of the distribution, the ratio of high-$\alpha$ to low-$\alpha$ stars, and the location of the high-$\alpha$ sequence if it exists. The SFH is the critical determining factor in bimodality.

    \item The distribution of [Fe/H] depends strongly on the chosen SFH, but there is only a weak effect from the DTD.

    \item The early-burst SFH model is the only one which produced a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe] across the disk resembling APOGEE, from the models we investigate. [Add: summary of why everything else fails.]

    \item Something about how radial migration can't produce bimodality on its own.
